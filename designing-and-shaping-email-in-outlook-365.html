In this video, you're also going to see how to create your own customized email template. You can insert a template into your newly opened email easily by firstly clicking the View Template option in the Message tab in a newly drafted email. Now that I've clicked this, a window has appeared titled My Templates, and we have different templates that we can enter into our email. At the top of the template is the title of the template, and underneath the title we can see text that will be inserted if we click on that template. I can add a template's text to this email easily by simply clicking on the template I want to add.<br><br>Now that I've clicked this template, I can see the text added to the body of my email. I can create a new template by clicking the '+ Template' button below the templates I can see. Now that I've clicked that, I can type in a new title for my new templates with the keys on my keyboard, as Title is already selected. Now that I've typed in a new title for this template, I can click underneath to type in a body for the template, which will be inserted into the body of the email when I click on this template. Now that I've typed in the text that I want to be inserted for this template, I can click Save below to save the template.<br><br>Now that I've clicked Save, I can see the template in the options under My Templates. You can edit a template by firstly hovering your mouse over the template that you want to edit. Once you do this, you'll see two icons appear in the upper right corner of the template. You can click the icon that looks like a pencil on a page to edit the template. Now that I've clicked this icon, we can change this template by either changing its title, or by clicking in the body section and editing the body of the template. Now that I've edited this template, I can click Save to save the changes that I've made. We can now see that this template has been edited and includes the additional text that we've added to it.<br><br>You can easily delete a template by once again hovering your mouse over the template that you want to delete and by clicking the icon in the upper right corner that looks like a bin to delete the template. It's possible to create your own custom templates to quickly structure frequently sent emails. Email templates can contain predefined text, images, styles, colors, recipients, email subjects, and even attachments.<br><br>To do this, first I'll open another drafted email that I have opened by hovering my mouse over the Outlook icon, then by clicking on the drafted email's thumbnail image. [Video description begins] He hovers over the Outlook icon in the taskbar. Thumbnails of each opened Outlook windows appear above the taskbar. [Video description ends]<br><br><br>This email has been formatted already and I want to save it as a custom template.<br><br>To do this, first I'll click the File tab in the top left corner of the newly drafted email. [Video description begins] The File backstage view opens with the navigation menu on the left, with options such as Info, Save As, Options, and so on.

[Video description ends]<br><br>I can save this template, but first I want to rename it so I'll use the keys on my keyboard to change the name of this file. If I want to save this as a template, I'll need to click Save as file type first, then select a different option from the dropdown menu. This time, I'll need to select Outlook Template to save this email as a template. Now, I'll click Save. To create a custom email using this template, I can simply click the New Items option in the New group in the top left corner of the Outlook interface that's behind this newly drafted email. First, I'll click on the interface to bring it forward. Now that I've clicked on it, I'll click New Items to create a new email with this template. Now that I've clicked that, I'll need to hover my mouse over More Items in the dropdown menu.<br><br>Now I'll click Choose form. [Video description begins] A Choose Form window opens and displays a Look in dropdown menu, a list of forms or templates, the Display name and File name fields, and the Open, Cancel, and Advanced buttons on the bottom right. [Video description ends]<br><br>Now that I've clicked Choose form, I'll need to select the dropdown menu by clicking the arrow pointing downward next to Look in. Now I'll need to select User Templates in File System, as this is a template we've saved in our file system. Now that I've done this, I can see the title of the template that we've created and I can click on it. Now, I can click Open to create a new email using this template. We can see that the template has been created in the interface. The template included our signature, and when we create a new email, our signature is automatically included as well.<br><br>We can edit this template or any predefined template that we've created and saved, just like we'd edit a normal email. I'll go ahead and click and drag to select text that I want to remove being the second signature, and I'll remove it using the keys on my keyboard. Now, I'll make some changes to the spacing using the keys on my keyboard to make the email look the way that I want it to look. Now that I've done that, I can click Send to send this email.</p><h2><br><strong>Customizing background &amp; theme</strong></h2><p>In Outlook, you can quickly apply themes to your messages in order to change the design of fonts and colors. In this video, you're also going to see how to change the background of your emails. It's possible to use themes to change the overall appearance of an email. You can apply a new theme to your email by simply clicking on the Options tab at the top of the newly drafted email, then by selecting the Themes icon in the Themes group in the top left corner of the ribbon. Now that I've clicked the Themes icon, I can see different themes that I can apply to this email. If I click on one of the themes, we'll be able to see it applied to the email. We can see the fonts changed, and we can also see the color of the colored text changed. We can change the colors of this theme by clicking the Colors option in the Themes group.<br><br>Now that I've clicked the Colors option, we can see different sets of colors that we can use for our theme. I can see that the colored font in this email has changed colors according to the theme we've selected. We can also change the font of the theme by clicking the Fonts icon, then by selecting a different option in the dropdown menu. Now that I've selected that, the font in this theme has changed. You can also add effects by clicking the Effects option, then by selecting an effect in this menu. I don't want to apply effect, so I'll click away from this menu to exit it without selecting an effect. It's also possible to reset your theme, browse for more themes, and also save your current theme, all in the Themes icon by clicking it in the Themes group. Now that I've clicked the Themes icon, I can see options to Reset to Theme from Template, Browse for Themes, or Save the Current Theme.<br><br>I want to reset the theme from template, so I'll go ahead and click Reset to Theme from Templates. It's also possible to change the background of your Outlook email. To do this, you can click the Page Color icon in the Themes group. I can see various different colors, including Theme Colors and Standard Colors. If I hover my mouse over one of these colors, we can see a preview of it applied to the background, and I can click to apply it. There's also options in the Page Color icon including No Color, which will remove the color. We can select More Colors, which will open a menu of more colors, or we can select Fill Effects to use a fill effect as the background. I'll select No Color to remove the color from the background.</p><h2><br><strong>Inserting QuickParts</strong></h2><p>Quick Parts can be used to store pieces of content that can then be quickly inserted into the body of your email. In this video, you're going to see how to quickly create an email in Outlook thanks to Quick Parts. Quick Parts can be used to store and reuse pieces of content and are useful for quickly building out an email using reusable items such as lists. To enter a Quick Part, first I'll click Quick Parts in the Text group. Now, I want to insert an AutoText that I've already created, so I'll hover my mouse over AutoText. I can see the list of departments I want to insert, so I'll go ahead and click List of departments. I can now see that list inserted into the body of my email. You can create a Quick Part AutoText by firstly clicking at the end of the text that you want to select to make the AutoText Quick Part, then by clicking and dragging to select the text.<br><br>Once you've done this, you can click the Quick Parts option in the Text group in the ribbon. Once you've done that, you can click Save Selection to Quick Part gallery. Now that I've click Save Selection to Quick Part gallery, a window has appeared titled Create New Building Block. I can change the name of this Quick Part by using the keys on my keyboard. Now that I've changed the name, I'll need to change the Gallery to AutoText to make this a Quick Part AutoText. I'll click the arrow pointing downward next to where it reads Quick Parts and I'll select AutoText. Below that, we have the Category option where we can click the arrow pointing downward, then select Create New category if we want to create a new category.<br><br>I'll click General, as I want this to fit into the General category. Below that we can click next to where it reads Description and add a description for this. I don't want to add a description, so I'll skip that option and leave it blank as it's not required. We can also see that it's being saved in NormalEmail. Below that we can see Options. Options is set to Insert content only. If I click the arrow pointing downward, I can choose to insert content in its own paragraph or insert content in its own page. I don't want either of those options, so I'll click Insert content only to leave it on this selection, and I'll click OK to save the change.<br><br>Now that I've clicked OK, I can click Quick Parts in the Text group again, then I can hover my mouse over AutoText and I can see the new Quick Part AutoText saved, and if we click on this it will insert it into the body of our email. I don't want to do that as this text is already contained in the body of our email. It's also possible to edit and delete AutoText. Deleting an AutoText Quick Part will not delete content already inserted in the email. If I right click on this AutoText, I'll have options to Insert at Current Document Position, Insert at Beginning of Document, Insert at End of Document, Edit Properties, Organize and Delete, or Add Gallery to Quick Access Toolbar. I'll click Organize and Delete.<br><br>Now that I've done this, the Building Block Organizer window has opened. In the Building Block Organizer, I can edit properties of one of my AutoText or Quick Parts, delete, or insert.

[Video description ends]<br><br><br>If I click Edit Properties while I have this AutoText selected, I can open the Modify Building Block window and I can change, for example, the name or another property to do with this AutoText. Now that I've renamed this AutoText, I'll go ahead and click OK. A dialog box has appeared asking if we want to redefine the building block entry - I'll click Yes. Now that I've done this, we can see the name has been changed for this AutoText. To delete an AutoText, you can simply click on the AutoText, then click Delete from the options below. Now that I've done this, a dialog box has once again appeared asking if we're sure we want to delete the selected building block. I'll go ahead and click Yes.</p><h2><br><strong>Inserting icons &amp; equations</strong></h2><p>If you want to insert symbols, icons or equations in your emails, Outlook has the tools you need. You can browse the equation tools to create simple and complex calculations and insert icons to stylize graphic elements to your message. It's possible to build out an email using icons and equations. It's useful when you're looking to insert calculations or stylized imagery. To access the icon gallery, you can simply click the Insert tab at the top of the interface in the newly drafted email, then you can click the Icons icon in the Illustrations group in the ribbon. Now that I've done this, the Icons gallery has appeared.<br><br>To insert an icon, I can simply click on the icon that I want to insert. If I want to insert more than one icon, I can simply click to select the other icon. We can now see that two icons will be inserted, indicated by the number 2 on the Insert button in the bottom right corner of the window. I'll go ahead and click Insert these icons. It's possible to edit icons like regular shapes. You can manually resize an icon by clicking on the dot on the border of the icon, then by dragging it to make it smaller or larger in your email. You can also change the graphic style by clicking on the icon, then by using the Graphics Styles group in the ribbon. If I click on another style, it will change the icon to that style. If I don't like any of the three styles shown here, I can click the arrow pointing downward to view more styles, or click the arrow in the bottom right corner of this to view all of the styles.<br><br>Now, I can select the style that I want. We can also change the shape fill by clicking Graphics Fill, then by selecting a different color from the menu that appears. We can change the graphics outline by clicking the Graphics Outline icon, then by selecting a different outline from the menu that appears. And we can add a graphics effect by clicking on Graphics Effect, then by selecting a graphics effect from the menu. I'll go ahead and click away from this menu as I don't want to add an effect now. You can remove an icon just like you would regular text. If you click to select an icon, you can simply push the Backspace key on your keyboard to delete it.<br><br>Using equations is also simple. To access the equations gallery, once again I'll need to click Insert at the top of the newly drafted email, then select Equation from the Symbols group in the ribbon. I can click the arrow pointing downward next to the equation option, and I can see the option to insert a new equation. There's also an option to Save Selection to Equation Gallery. If we already have an equation in the email, we can use this by clicking and dragging to select the equation, then by clicking this button. I'll go ahead and click Insert New Equation. Text has appeared in our email reading "Type equation here". I can click the arrow pointing downward next to this equation that we've inserted to see equation option.<br><br>We can see that we can save as a new equation, set to professional, set to linear, set all to professional, set all the linear, change the display, or use justification options. I'll click away from this to exit it. We also have options in the ribbon in relation to setting up this equation. We have a Tools group which allows us to click an Equation button to insert another equation. We have the Professional option, the Linear option, and the Normal Text option in Tools. In the Symbols group, we can add symbols for the equation. And in the Structures group, we can add different structures including fractions, e scripts, radicals, integrals, large operators, brackets, functions, accents, limits and logs, operator, and matrix.<br><br>If I click the arrow pointing downward under Fraction, I can, for example, click one of these options for fraction. Now that I've created the fraction, I can click in the box on the fraction, then use the keys on my keyboard to populate it with text. Now that I've clicked, I've pushed 1 on the top half of the fraction, and if I click in the box underneath it I can push 4 to make the fraction 1/4 in this equation box. I can click away from this to show it without the box around it, as it will be shown in the drafted email.<br><br>We can make this equation bigger by clicking and dragging to select it, then by making it bigger using the font size option in the Basic Text group. If I click the arrow pointing downward, I can then select a bigger size to increase the size of the equation. You can edit this equation as normal text with most tools in the Basic Text group. To remove this equation, first I'll click on the equation again. Now, I'll click on the three dots that appear in the upper left corner of the equation box. Now that I've selected that, I could push Backspace on my keyboard to delete the equation.</p><h2><br><strong>Inserting 3D models</strong></h2><p>With Outlook, you can insert 3D models into your emails. In this video, you're going to see how to insert a 3-dimensional image and use 3D model tools. It's possible to insert one or more 3D models into emails from a computer or stock gallery.

At the top, you can select which email account you want to choose the settings for. Right now we only have <a href="mailto:john.smith@homoticcorp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">john.smith@homoticcorp.com</a> added to this Outlook client, so it's the only account that we can change. If we click the arrow pointing downward next to this contact, we'll see that the list is empty. If we had any other email addresses added to this client, we'd be able to see them in this list and click them to view and edit their signatures.

It's letting us know that all email accounts that are using that signature will no longer have a signature. I'll go ahead and click Yes.</p><h2><br><strong>Customizing reply &amp; forward messages</strong></h2><p>In Outlook, when you try to reply or forward an email message, the original message is included below the new message.

By default, Include original message text is selected. That's why we can see the original message's text when we clicked Reply. I'm going to select Do not include original message. Now that I've changed this setting, I can click OK in this menu to validate the change. I'll go ahead and discard this reply that we previously drafted by clicking the Discard button in the upper right corner of the email.<br><br>Now that I've done this, I can click the Reply button on the same email again.
