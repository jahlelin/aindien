If left alone, people will generally not account for how their actions affect other, whether positive or negative. They are called market failures because of the negative effects. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are important cases in which free markets fail to maximize social surplus. Three such cases are:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Externalities</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public goods</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common pool resources</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One common link among these three examples is that there is a difference between the private benefits and costs and the social benefits and costs. Government can play a role in improving market outcomes in such cases.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market demand curve shows consumers’ willingness and ability to pay for electricity, and the market supply curve reflects producers’ marginal costs of generating it. It is at the equilibrium point where these two lines intersect that the invisible hand most efficiently allocates resources, the point at which social good is maxed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downward sloping demand curve meets the upward sloping supply curve. To determine the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity of electricity.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In economic terms, the power plant imposes an externality on the public as a by-product of producing electricity. An externality occurs when an economic activity has either a spillover cost to or a spillover benefit for a bystander. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When there are negative externalities present, this market outcome is no longer efficient. This is because negative externalities impose an additional cost on society that is not explicitly recognized by the buyers and sellers in the market. To arrive at the efficient production level, we need to recognize both the firm's marginal cost and the marginal external costs of production. Together, they sum to the marginal social cost of production. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negative externalities lead to external costs of production that the private firm will not account for when making decisions. If we take the marginal external cost into account, a higher equilibrium price and a lower equilibrium quantity result.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking into account the extra costs imposed on society by the plant’s pollution, we can see that optimal quantity is less than market quantity because when a negative externality must be accounted for, a smaller quantity of electricity should be generated since it is now more costly to produce each unit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deadweight loss is a decrease in social surplus that results from a market distortion.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive externalities occur when an economic activity has a spillover benefit that is not considered when people make their decisions. As with negative externalities, they are all around us. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pecuniary externalities exist when market transactions affect other people, but only through the market price. They act only through prices. Remember that negative and positive externalities lead to wrong equilibrium quantities. They do so because they create an external cost or external benefit that is not reflected in the market price. Pecuniary externalities don’t create these effects. Precisely because their impact is completely embodied in prices, the market price correctly reflects the society's wider impact of market transactions. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When there are negative externalities present, free markets produce and consume too much. When there are positive externalities present, free markets produce and consume too little. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When individuals or companies take into account the full costs and benefits of their actions because of some public or private incentive, economists say that they are internalizing the externalities. When the external effects of their actions are internalized, the general result is that the market equilibrium moves toward higher social well-being. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The insight that negotiation leads to the socially efficient outcome regardless of who has the legal property right is called the Coase Theorem. The theorem’s implication is powerful, private bargaining will lead to an efficient allocation of resources. This means that the person who values the ownership the most will match his preferences. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governments respond to externalities in two main ways:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Command control policies in which the government directly regulates the allocation of resources.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market based policies in which the government provides incentives for private organizations to internalize the externality.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under command and control regulation, policymakers either directly restrict the level of production or mandate the use of certain technologies. However, this type of regulation action typically provides few incentives for producers to search for more cost effective ways to reduce pollution. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A market based approach internalizes externalities by harnessing the power of market forces. The most prominent market based approaches to deal with externalities are corrective taxes and subsidies. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A corrective or Pigoivian tax is designed to induce agents who produce negative externalities to reduce quantity toward the socially optimal level. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a social planner, you understand that you must internalize externalities. One solution is to tax each unit of production by the amount of the negative externality. Such a tax allows the externality to be internalized, resulting in a more efficient outcome. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same reasoning that holds for negative externalities also applies to positive externalities, the government can use corrective subsidies to internalize the externality. A corrective subsidy is designed to induce agents who produce positive externalities to increase quantity toward the socially optimal level.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, externalities potentially drive a wedge between social benefits and costs and private benefits and costs. This wedge creates a distortion and deadweight loss if the quantity levels of the free market equilibrium diverge from those of the social optimum. Corrective taxes and subsidies can cause agents to internalize their externalities. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public goods:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one can prevent others from consumption</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One person’s consumption doesn’t prevent another person’s consumption</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private goods are excludable, meaning that people can be kept from consuming them if they have not paid for them. Public goods are non-excludable, meaning that once such goods are produced, it is not possible to exclude people from using them.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private goods are rival in consumption, meaning that they cannot be consumed by more than one person at a time. Public goods are non rival in consumption, meaning that one person’s consumption does not preclude consumption by others. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To summarize, we can say that private goods are excludable and rival in consumption and public goods are non excludable and nonrival in consumption. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ordinary private goods are both highly excludable and highly rival in consumption. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goods that are highly excludable but nonrival in consumption are called club goods or artificially scarce goods. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common pool resource goods are nonexcludable but rival in consumption.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public goods are nonrival and nonexcludable in nature. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes public goods different from private goods is precisely their nonrival and nonexcludable nature. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public goods need to be valued on the marginal benefit that a single unit of the good provides to society. For this reason, market demand curves for public goods are added along the vertical axis, producing a total willingness to pay for each unit of the public good. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private provision of public goods refers to any situation in which private citizens make contributions to the production or maintenance of a public good. This usually happens through donations of time and money. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common pool resource goods are nonexcludable so anyone can consume as much as they can. However, they are rival goods. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tragedy of the commons occurs when a common resource is used too much. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three major examples of when the invisible hand fails are externalities, public goods, and common pool resources. In each case, free markets typically do not maximize social surplus.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Externalities can occur in many shapes and sizes. They can be either positive or negative and can occur in consumption or production. The solution to externalities can come is meant by the tragedy of the commons through private or public means. The key to each is internalizing the externality. In doing so, we can align private and social incentives to maximize overall well-being.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public goods, which can be provided publicly or privately, are nonrival in consumption and are nonexcludable. This means that once they are provided, no one can be excluded, and all agents can consume them at the same time.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common pool resource goods are not excludable but are rival. This leads to an important negative externality that one person imposes on all others. Once the bluegil is taken out of the stream, no one else can catch it. Therefore, solutions to common pool resource problems mirror solutions to externalities.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key link between externalities, public goods, and common pool resources is that there is a difference between the private benefit and costs and the social benefits and costs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which of the following is not an externality?</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jordan has lung cancer from smoking cigarettes</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the private market for these pesticides shown in the graph on the right.
