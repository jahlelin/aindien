Scarcity is when human wants are greater than the available supply of time, goods, and resources. The problems of scarcity and choice are basic economic problems faced by every society. Resources are the basic categories of inputs used to produce goods and services. Land is any natural resource provided by nature that is used to produce a good or service. Labor is the mental and physical capacity of workers to produce goods and services. Entrepreneurship is the creative ability of individuals to seek profits by taking risks and combining resources to produce innovative products.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital is a human-made good used to produce other goods and services. Money by itself does not produce goods and services. It is only a means to facilitate the purchase and sale of resources and consumer goods. Economics is therefore the study of how society chooses to allocate its scarce resources to the production of goods and services to satisfy unlimited wants. Macroeconomics is the branch of economics that studies decision making for the economy as a whole. Microeconomics is the branch that studies decision making by a single individual, household, firm, industry, or level of government. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A model is a simplified description of reality used to understand and predict the relationship between variables. Ceteris paribus is a Latin phrase that means while certain things change, all other things remain unchanged. A theory cannot be tested legitimately unless its ceteris paribus assumption is satisfied. The fact that one event follows another does not necessarily mean that the first event caused the second event. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive economics is an analysis limited to statements that are verifiable. Economists’ forecasts can differ because using the same methodology, economists can agree that event X causes event Y, but disagree over the assumption that event X will occur. Normative economics is an analysis based on subjective value judgements. When opinions or points of view are not based on facts, they are scientifically untestable. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A direct relationship is a positive association between two variables. When one variable increases, the other variable increases. Also, when one variable decreases, the other variable decreases. An inverse relationship is a negative association between two variables. When one variable decreases, the other also decreases. The slope of a graph is the ratio of the change in the variable on the vertical axis to the change in the variable on the horizontal axis. An independent relationship means a zero association between two variables. When one variable changes, the other variable remains unchanged.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A shift in a curve occurs only when the ceteris paribus assumption is relaxed and a third variable not shown on either axis of the graph is allowed to change. </span></p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ggd05lhp2jo" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Production Possibilities</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opportunity cost is the best alternative sacrificed for a chosen alternative. Marginal analysis is an examination of the effects of additions or subtractions from a current situation. The production possibilities curve shows the maximum combinations of two outputs an economy can produce in a given period of time with its available resources and technology. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology is the body of knowledge applied to how goods are produced. Scarcity limits an economy to points on or below its production possibilities curve. The production possibilities curve consists of all efficient output combinations at which an economy can produce more of one good only by producing less of the other good. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law of increasing opportunity costs is the principle that the opportunity cost increases as production of one output expands. Because resources are not equally well -suited to producing all products, it is common to experience increasing opportunity costs and a bowed-out production possibilities curve. Economic growth is the ability of an economy to produce greater levels of output, represented by an outward shift of its production possibilities curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An investment is the accumulation of capital, such as factories, machines, and inventories, used to produce goods and services. A nation can accelerate economic growth by increasing its production of capital goods in excess of the capital being worn out in the production process. </span></p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ggd05lhp2jp" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Demand and Supply</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law of demand is the principle that there is an inverse relationship between the price of a good and the quantity buyers are willing to purchase in a defined time period. A demand curve shows the various quantities of product consumers are willing to purchase at possible prices during a specified period of time. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A change in quantity demanded is a movement between points along a stationary demand curve. The change in demand is an increase or decrease in the quantity demanded at each possible price. An increase in demand is a rightward shift in the entire demand curve. A decrease in demand is a leftward shift in the entire demand curve. Under the law of demand, any decrease in price along the vertical axis will cause an increase in quantity demanded, measured along the horizontal axis, and appears as a movement along the demand curve. Changes in non-price determinants can produce only a shift in the demand curve and not a movement along the demand curve.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A normal good is any good for which there is a direct relationship between changes in income and its demand curve. An inferior good is any good for which there is an inverse relationship between changes in income and its demand curve. A substitute good is one that competes with another good for consumer purchases. As a result, there is a direct relationship between a price change for one good and the demand for its competitor good. The complementary good is a good that is jointly consumed with another good. As a result, there is an inverse relationship between a price change for one good and the demand for its “go together” good. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law of supply is the principle that there is a direct relationship between the price of a good and the quantity sellers are willing to offer for sale in a defined time period. The supply curve shows the various quantities of a product sellers are willing to produce and offer for sale at possible prices during a specified time period.  Only at a higher price will it be profitable for sellers to incur the higher opportunity cost associated with producing and supplying a larger quantity. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change in quantity supplied is a movement between points along a stationary supply curve. Under the law of supply, any increase in price along the vertical axis will cause an increase in the quantity supplied, measured along the horizontal axis, and appears as a movement along the supply curve. A change in supply is an increase or decrease in the quantity supplied at each possible price. An increase in supply is a rightward shift in the entire supply curve. A decrease in supply is a leftward shift in the entire supply curve. Changes in non-price determinants can produce only a shift in the supply curve and not a movement along the supply curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A market is any arrangement in which buyers and sellers interact to determine the price and quantity of goods and services exchanged. A surplus is a market condition existing at any price where the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded. A shortage is a market condition existing at any price where the quantity supplied is less than the quantity demanded. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The equilibrium is a market condition that occurs at any price and quantity at which the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal. Graphically, the intersection of the supply curve and the demand curve is the market equilibrium price-quantity point. When all other non-price factors are held constant, this is the only stable coordinate on the graph. A price system is a mechanism that uses the forces of supply and demand to create an equilibrium through rising and falling prices. </span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ggd05lhp2jq" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>The Markets</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price ceiling in a market is a legally established maximum price a seller can charge. Conversely, a price floor is a legally established minimum price a seller can be paid. A price ceiling or price floor prevents market adjustment in which competition among buyers and sellers bids the price upward or downward to the equilibrium price. A market failure in which market equilibrium results in too few or too many resources being used in the production of a good or service. This inefficiency may justify government intervention. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An externality is a cost or benefit imposed on people other than the consumers and producers of a good or service. When the supply curve fails to include external costs, the equilibrium price is artificially low, and the equilibrium quantity is artificially high. External costs cause the market to overallocate resources. Then, when the demand curve fails to include external benefits the equilibrium price is artificially low, and the equilibrium quantity is artificially low. External benefits cause the market to underallocate resources. A public good has two properties. Users collectively consume benefits and there is no way to bar people who do not pay from consuming the good or service. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If public goods are available only in the marketplace, people wait for someone else to pay, and the result is an underproduction or zero production of public goods.</span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ggsqc11p41u" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Price Elasticity of Demand</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price elasticity of demand is the ratio of the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a product to a percentage change in its price. Elastic demand is a condition in which the percentage change in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage change in price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total revenue is the number of dollars a firm earns from the sale of a good or service, which is equal to its price multiplied by the quantity demanded.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inelastic demand is a condition in which the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price. Unitary elastic demand is a condition in which the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price. Perfectly elastic demand is a condition in which a small percentage change in price brings about an infinite percentage change in quantity demanded. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfectly inelastic demand is a condition in which the quantity demanded does not change as the price changes.  The price elasticity coefficient of demand applies only to a specific range of prices. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price elasticity coefficient of demand is directly related to the availability of suitable substitutes for a product. The price elasticity coefficient of demand is directly related to the percentage of one’s budget spent for a good or service. In general, the price elasticity coefficient of demand is higher the longer a price change persists. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the demand curve slopes downward and the supply curve slopes upward, sellers cannot raise the price by the full amount of the tax. In the case where demand is perfectly inelastic, sellers can raise the price by the full amount of a tax.  </span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ggsqc11p41v" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Production Costs</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explicit costs are payments to nonowners of a firm for their resources. Implicit costs are the opportunity costs of using resources owned by a firm. Economic profit is total revenue minus explicit and implicit costs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normal profit is the minimum profit necessary to keep a firm in operation. A firm that earns normal profits earns total revenue equal to its total opportunity cost. Since business decision making is based on economic profit, rather than accounting profit, the word profit always means economic profit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixed input is any resource for which the quantity cannot change during the period of time under consideration. A variable input is any resource for which the quantity can change during the time under consideration.  A short run is a period of time so short that there is at least one fixed input. A long run is a period of time so long that all inputs are variable. The production function is the relationship between the maximum amounts of output a firm can produce and various quantities of inputs. A marginal product is the change in total output produced by adding one unit of a variable input, with all other inputs used being held constant. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The  law of diminishing returns is the principle that beyond some point the marginal product decreases as additional units of a variable factor are added to a fixed factor. The total fixed cost is a cost that does not vary as output varies and that must be paid even if output is zero. These are payments that the firm must make in the short run, regardless of the level of output. The total variable cost is the cost that is zero when output is zero and varies as output varies. The total cost is the sum of total fixed cost and total variable cost at each level of output. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average fixed cost is the total fixed cost divided by the quantity of output produced. The average variable cost is the total variable cost divided by the quantity of output produced. The average total cost is the total cost divided by the quantity divided by the quantity of output produced. The marginal cost is the change in total cost when one additional unit of output is produced. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The marginal average rule is the rule that states when marginal cost is below average cost, average cost falls. When marginal cost is above average cost, average cost rises. When marginal cost equals average cost, average cost is at its minimum point. A firm operates in the short run when there is insufficient time to alter some fixed input. The firm plans in the long run when all inputs are variable. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long run average cost curve traces the lowest cost per unit at which a firm can produce any level of output when the firm can build any desired plant size. Economies at scale is a situation in which the long run average cost curve declines as the firm increases output. The constant returns to scale is a situation in which the long run average cost curve does not change as the firm increases output. Diseconomies of scale is a situation in which the long run average cost curve rises as the firm increases output. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic profit is equal to total revenue minus both explicit and implicit costs. Explicit costs are payments to nonowners of a firm for their resources. Implicit costs are the opportunity costs of forgone returns to resources owned by a firm. Economic profit is total revenue minus explicit and implicit costs. Economic profit can be positive, zero, or negative. Economic profit is important for decision making purposes because it includes implicit costs and accounting profit does not. Accounting profit equals total revenue minus explicit costs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normal profit is the minimum profit necessary to keep a firm in operation. A normal profit is a zero economic profit, and it signifies there is just enough total revenue to pay the owners for all explicit and implicit costs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fixed input is any resource for which the quantity cannot change during the period of time under consideration. A variable input is any resource for which the quantity can change during the period of time under consideration. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short run is a time period during which a firm has at least one fixed input, such as its factory size. The long run for a firm is defined as a period during which all inputs are variable.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A production function is the relationship between output and inputs. Holding all other factors of production constant, the production function shows the total output as the amount of one input, such as labor, varies. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginal product is the change in total output caused by a one unit change in a variable input, such as the number of workers hired. The law of diminishing returns states that after some level of output in the short run, each additional unit of the variable input yields a smaller and smaller marginal product. This range of declining marginal products is the region of diminishing returns.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total fixed cost consists of costs that do not vary with the level of output, such as rent for office space. Total fixed cost is the cost of inputs that do not change as a firm changes output in the short run. Total variable cost consists of costs that vary with the level of output, such as wages. Total cost is the sum of total fixed cost and total variable cost. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginal cost is the change in total cost associated with one additional unit of output. Average fixed cost is the total fixed cost divided by total output. Average variable cost is the total variable cost divided by total output. Average total cost is the total cost divided by output, or the sum of average fixed cost and average variable cost. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The marginal-average rule explains the relationship between marginal cost and average cost. When marginal cost is less than average cost, average cost falls. When marginal cost is greater than average cost, average cost rises. Following this rule, the marginal cost curve intersects the average variable cost curve and the average total cost curve at their minimum points. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-run average cost curve is a curve drawn tangent to all possible short run average total cost curves. When it decreases as output increases, a firm experiences economies at scale. If it remains unchanged as output increases, a firm experiences constant returns to scale. If the curve increases as output increases, a firm experiences diseconomies at scale. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since business decision making is based on economic profit, rather than accounting profit, the work profit in this text always means economic profit. A firm operates in the short run when there is insufficient time to alter some fixed input. The firm plans in the long run when all inputs are variable. The plant size selected by a firm in the long run depends on the expected level of production.  </span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ggv6p9gj59u" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Perfect Competition</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market structure is a classification system for the key traits of a market, including the number of firms, the similarity of products they sell, and the ease of entry into and exit from the market. Perfect competition is a market structure characterized by a large number of small firms, a homogeneous product, and very easy entry into or exit from the market. Perfect competition is also called pure competition. The large number of sellers' conditions is met when each firm is so small relative to the total market that no single firm can influence the market price.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A homogeneous product is a good or service that is identical regardless of which firm produces it. If a product is homogeneous, buyers are indifferent as to which seller’s product they buy. A barrier to entry is any obstacle that makes it difficult for a new firm to enter a market. Perfect competition requires that resources be completely mobile to freely enter or exit a market. A price taker is a seller that has no control over the price of the product it sells. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginal revenue is the change in total revenue from the sale of one additional unit of output. In perfect competition, the firm’s marginal revenue equals the price, which the firm views as a horizontal demand curve. In perfect competition, the firm maximizes profit or minimizes loss by producing the output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The firm will shut down when the price drops below the minimum average variable cost. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfectly competitive firm’s short run supply curve is a firm’s marginal cost curve above the minimum point on its average variable cost curve. The perfectly competitive industry’s short run supply curve is the supply curve derived from horizontal summation of the marginal cost curves of all firms in the industry above the minimum point of each firm’s average variable cost curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfectly competitive industry’s long run supply curve is the curve that shows the quantities supplied by the industry at different equilibrium prices after firms complete their entry and exit. A constant cost industry is an industry in which the expansion of industry output by the entry of new firms has no effect on the individual firm’s average total cost curve. The long run supply curve in a perfectly competitive constant cost industry is perfectly elastic and drawn as a horizontal line. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market structure consists of three market characteristics; number of sellers, nature of the product, and ease of entry into the market. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfect competition is a market structure in which an individual firm cannot affect the price of the product it produces. Each firm in the industry is very small relative to the market as a whole, all the firms sell a homogenous product, and firms are free to enter and exit the industry. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A homogenous product is a good or service that is identical regardless of which firm produces it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A price taker firm in perfect competition faces a perfectly elastic demand curve. It can sell all it wishes at the market determined price, but it will sell nothing above the given market  price. This is because so many competitive firms are willing to sell the same product at the going market price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total revenue total cost method is one way a firm determines the level of output that maximizes profit. Profit reaches a maximum when the vertical difference between the total revenue and the total cost curve is a maximum. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The marginal revenue equals marginal cost method is a second approach to finding where a firm maximizes profits. Marginal revenue is the change in total revenue from a one unit change in output. Marginal revenue for a perfectly competitive firm equals the market price. The mr=mc rule states that the firm maximizes profit or minimizes loss by producing the output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. If the price is below the minimum point on the average variable cost curve, the mr=mc rule does not apply, and the firm shuts down to minimize its losses. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The perfectly competitive firm’s short-run supply curve is a curve showing the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity supplied in the short run. The individual firm always produces along its marginal cost curve above its intersection with the average variable cost curve. The perfectly competitive industry’s short-run supply curve is the horizontal summation of the short-run supply curves of all the firms in the industry. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long run perfectly competitive equilibrium occurs when a firm earns a normal profit by producing where price equals the minimum long-run average cost, the minimum short-run average, and the short-run marginal cost. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a constant-cost industry, total output can be expanded without an increase in the individual firm’s average total cost. Because input prices remain constant, the long-run supply curve in a constant-cost industry is perfectly elastic. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The large number of sellers' conditions is met when each firm is so small relative to the total market that no single firm can influence the market price. If a product is homogenous, buyers are indifferent as to which seller’s product they buy. Perfect competition requires resources to be completely mobile to freely enter or exit a market. In perfect competition, the firms’ marginal revenue equals the prices, which the firm views as a horizontal demand curve.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In perfect competition, the firm maximizes profit or minimizes losses by producing the output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The firm will shut down when the price drops below the minimum average variable cost. The long-run supply curve is a perfectly competitive constant-cost industry that is perfectly elastic and drawn as a horizontal line.</span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1gi1blfau56" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Monopoly</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A monopoly is a market structure characterized by a single seller, unique product, and impossible entry into the market. A natural monopoly is an industry in which the long run average cost of production declines throughout the entire market. As a result, a single firm can supply the entire market demand at a lower cost than two or more smaller firms. A network good is one that increases in value to each user as the total number of users increases. As a result, a firm can achieve economies of scale. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of economies of scale, a single firm in an industry can produce enough output to satisfy market demand and produce this output at a lower per unit cost than would be possible if the market was served by more than one firm. As the number of people connected to a network goods system increases, the greater the benefits each person receives from being in the network. A price maker is a firm that faces a downward sloping demand curve and therefore it can choose among the price and output combinations along the demand curve.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand and marginal revenue curves of the monopolist are downward sloping. In contrast to the horizontal demand and corresponding marginal revenue curves facing the perfectly competitive firm. The marginal revenue curve for a straight line demand curve intersects the quantity axis halfway between the origin and the quantity axis intercept of the demand curve. The monopolist always maximizes profit by producing at a price on the elastic segment of its demand curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the positions of a monopolist’s demand and cost curves give it a profit and nothing disturbs these curves, the monopolist will earn profit in the long run. Price descrimination is the practice of a seller charging different prices for the same product that are not justified by cost differences. Arbitrage is the practice of earning a profit by buying a good at a low price and reselling the good at a higher price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A monopolist is characterized by inefficiency because resources are underallocated to the production of its product. Monopoly harms consumers on two fronts. The monopolist charges a higher price and produces a lower output that would result under a perfectly competitive market structure.   </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monopoly is a single seller that faces the entire industry demand curve because it is the only seller. The monopolist sells a unique product, and extremely high barriers to entry protect it from competition. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barriers to entry that prevent new firms from entering an industry are: ownership of an essential resource, legal barriers, and economies of scale. Government franchises, licenses, patents, and copyrights are the most obvious legal barriers to entry.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural monopoly arises because of the existence of economies of scale in which the long-run average cost curve falls over the full range of output demanded in the market. Economies of scale allow a single firm, rather than several firms, to produce enough output to satisfy the entire market demand at the lowest possible cost. Whichever firm expands first gains a cost advantage and monopoly status, as smaller firms leave the industry because of their high costs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A network good is a good that increases in value to each user as the total number of users increases. A price maker firm faces a downward sloping demand curve. It therefore searches its demand curve to find the price-output combination that maximizes its profit or minimizes its losses. The marginal revenue and demand curves are downward sloping for a monopolist. The marginal revenue curve for a monopolist lies below the demand curve, and the total revenue curve reaches its maximum where marginal revenue equals zero. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price elasticity of demand corresponds to sections of the marginal revenue curve. When MR is positive, price elasticity of demand is elastic. When MR is equal to zero, price elasticity of demand is unit elastic. When MR equal is negative, price elasticity of demand is inelastic. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short run profit maximizing monopolist, like the perfectly competitive firm, locates the profit maximizing price by producing the output where the MR and MC curves intersect. If this price is greater than the average total cost, the firm earns an economic profit. If the price is less than average total cost but greater than average variable cost, the firm loses money but remains in business. Finally, if the price is less than the average variable cost, the monopolist shuts down to minimize losses. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long run profit maximizing monopolist earns a profit because of barriers to entry. If demand is low and costs or high, thus creating the prospect of long run losses, the monopolist will leave the industry. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price descrimination allows the monopolist to increase profits by charging buyers different prices rather than a single price. Three conditions are necessary for price descrimination: the seller possesses some price setting ability, buyers in different markets must have different price elasticities of demand, and buyers must be prevented from reselling the product at a higher price than the purchase price.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monopoly disadvantages include the following: a monopolist charges a higher price and produces less output than a perfectly competitive firm. Resource allocation is inefficient because the monopolist produces less than if competition existed. Monopoly produces higher long run profits than if competition existed. Monopoly transfers income from consumers to producers to a greater degree than under perfect competition. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of economies of scale, a single firm in an industry will produce output at a lower pre-unit cost than two or more firms.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the number of people connected to a network goods system increases, the greater the benefit each person receives from the network goods. The demand and marginal revenue curves of the monopolist are downward sloping in contrast to the horizontal demand and corresponding marginal revenue curves facing the perfectly competitive firm. The marginal revenue curve for a straight line demand curve intersects the quantity axis halfway between the origin and the quantity axis intercept of the demand curve. The monopolist always maximizes profit by producing at a price on the elastic segment of its demand curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the positions of a monopolist’s demand and cost curves give it a profit and nothing disturbs these curves, the monopolist will earn profit in the long run. A monopolist is characterized by inefficiency because resources are under allocated to the production of its product. Monopoly harms consumers on two fronts. The monopolist charges a higher price and produces a lower output than would result under a perfectly competitive market structure.  </span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1guiacqoh1ju" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monopolistic competition is a market structure characterized by many small sellers, a differentiated product, and easy market entry or exit. The many-sellers condition is met when each firm is so small relative to the total market that its pricing decisions have a negligible effect on the market price. Product differentiation is the process of creating real or apparent differences between goods and services. A firm can charge higher prices if it makes its products seem unique. Nonprice competition is the situation in which a firm competes using advertising, packaging, product development, better quality, and better service, rather than low prices. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand curve for a monopolistically competitive firm is less elastic, or steeper,  than for a perfectly competitive firm and more elastic, or flatter, than for a monopolist. Oligopoly is a market structure characterized by few large sellers, either a homogenous or a differentiated product, and difficult market entry. Mutual interdependence is a condition in which an action by one firm may cause a reaction from other firms. The few-sellers condition is met when these few firms are so large relative to the total market that they can affect the market price. Buyers in an oligopoly may or may not be indifferent as to which seller’s product they buy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price leadership is a pricing strategy in which a dominant firm sets the price for an industry and the other firms follow. A cartel is a group of firms that formally agree to reduce competition by coordinating the price and output of a product. Game theory is a model of the strategic moves and countermoves of rivals. The payoff matrix demonstrates why a competitive oligopoly tends to result in both rivals using a low-price strategy that does not maximize mutual profits. As long as the benefits exceed the costs, cheating can threaten formal or informal agreements among oligopolists to maximize joint profits.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monopolistic competition is a market structure characterized by many small sellers, a differentiated product, and easy entry or exit from the market. Given these characteristics, firms in monopolistic competition have a negligible effect on the market price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product differentiation is a key characteristic of monopolistic competition. It is the process of creating real or apparent differences between products. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonprice competition includes advertising, packaging, product development, better quality, and better service. Under monopolistic competition and oligopoly, firms may compete using nonprice competition, rather than price competition. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short run equilibrium for a monopolistic competitor can yield economic losses, zero economic profits, or economic profits. In the long run, monopolistic competitors make zero economic profits.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comparing monopolistic competition with perfect competition, we find that in the long run the monopolistically competitive firm does not achieve allocative efficiency, charges a higher price, restricts output, and does not produce where average costs are at a minimum. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oligopoly is a market structure characterized by few sellers, homogeneous or differentiated products, and difficult market entry. Oligopolies are mutually interdependent because an action by one firm may cause a reaction from other firms.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nonprice competition model is a theory that might explain oligopolistic behavior. Under this theory, firms use advertising and product differentiation, rather than precise reductions, to compete. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price leadership is another theory of pricing behavior under oligopoly. When a dominant firm in an industry raises or lowers its price, other firms follow suit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cartel is a formal agreement among firms to set prices and output quotas. The goal is to maximize joint profits, but firms have an incentive to cheat, which is a constant threat to a cartel. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game theory reveals that oligopolies are mutually interdependent in their pricing policies, without collusion, oligopoly prices and mutual profits are lower, and oligopolists have a temptation to cheat on any collusive agreement.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comparing oligopoly with perfect competition, we find that the oligopolist allocates resources inefficiently, charges a higher price, and restricts output so that price may exceed average cost enabling long run profits.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The many sellers’ condition is met when each firm is so small relative to the total market that its pricing decisions have a negligible effect on the market price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A firm can charge higher prices if it makes its products seem unique.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand curve for a monopolistically competitive firm is less elastic than for a perfectly competitive firm and more elastic than for a monopolist.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The few-sellers condition is met when these few firms are so large relative to the total market that they can affect the market price.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buyers in an oligopoly may or may not be indifferent as to which seller’s product they buy.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The payoff matrix demonstrates why a competitive oligopoly tends to result in both rivals using a low price strategy that does not maximize mutual profits.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as the benefits exceed the costs, cheating can threaten formal or informal agreements among oligopolists to maximize joint profits.</span></p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1gftjp5f8p7" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>GDP</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gross domestic product is the market value of all final goods and services produced in a nation during a period of time.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the most reported measurement of an economy. GDP includes only current transactions, meaning final sales. It does not count purely private or public financial transactions. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A transfer payment is a government payment to individuals not in exchange for goods or services currently produced.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDP only counts final goods that are sold or produced. Final goods are finished goods or services produced for the ultimate user. Intermediate goods are goods and services used as inputs for the production of final goods.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The circular flow model shows the exchange of money, products, and resources between households and businesses. The upper half represents product markets, in which households exchange money for goods and services produced by firms. The bottom half of the diagram represents the factor markets, in which firms demand the natural resources, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship needed to produce the goods and services sold in the product markets. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expenditure approach is the national income accounting method that measures GDP by adding all the spending for final goods during a period of time. This includes</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C - personal consumption</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I  - investment</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">G- government spending</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(X-M) - net exports</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Formula for GDP = C+ I + G + (X-M)</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because GDP only counts market transactions, it excludes activities that are unpaid like child rearing. GDP is blind to whether a small fraction of the population consumes most of a country’s GDP or consumption is evenly divided. GDP is a quantitative, rather than a qualitative measure of the output of goods and services. GDP does not directly measure quality of life variables such as leisure time. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be argued that GDP understates national well being because no allowance is made for variables such as leisure time, life expectancy, and other such things.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Underground activities are not counted for GDP because there are no transaction records. If the underground economy is sizable, GDP will understate an economy’s performance by a sizable amount. Since the costs of negative by-products are not deducted, GDP overstates the national well-being.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, GDP has been expressed as nominal GDP. Nominal GDP is the value of all final goods based on the prices existing during the time period of production. This adjusted GDP allows meaningful comparison over time when prices are changing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measuring the difference between changes in output and changes in the price level involves making an important distinction between nominal GDP and real GDP. Real GDP is the value of all final goods produced during a given time period based on the prices existing in selected base year. GDP chain price index is a measure that compares changes in the prices of all final goods during a given year relative to the prices of those goods in a base year. This index is also called GDP price index or simply GDP deflator. </span></p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1gftjp5f8p8" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Business and Unemployment</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The business cycle is alternating periods of economic growth and contraction. These changes are measured in real GDP. The peak is the phase of the business cycle in which real GDP reaches its maximum after rising during a recovery. A recession is the downturn in the business cycle during which GDP declines and the unemployment rate rises. It is also called a contraction.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trough is the phase of the business cycle in which real GDP reaches its minimum after falling during a recession. An expansion is an upturn in the business cycle during which real GDP rises. This is also known as a recovery. Economic growth is an expansion in national output measured by the annual percentage increase in a nation’s real GDP.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We value economic growth as one of our nation’s economic goals because it increases our standard of living. Leading indicators are variables that change before real GDP changes. Coincident indicators are variables that change at the same time that real GDP changes. Lagging indicators are variables that change after real GDP changes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unemployment rate is the percentage of people in the civilian labor force who are without jobs and are actively seeking jobs. The civilian labor force is the number of people 16 years or older who are employed or who are actively seeking a job, excluding armed forces, homemakers, discouraged workers, and other persons not in the labor force.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A discouraged worker is a person who wants to work but has given up searching for work because they believe there will be no job offers. Frictional unemployment is temporary unemployment caused by the time required of workers to move from one job to another. Structural unemployment is caused by a mismatch of skills of workers out of work and the skills required for existing job opportunities.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing is the practice of a company having its work done by another company in another country. Offshoring is the practice of work for a company being performed by the company’s employees located in another country. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyclical unemployment is caused by the lack of jobs during a recession. Full employment is the situation in which an economy operates at an unemployment rate equal to the sum of the frictional and structural unemployment rates. This is also called the natural rate of unemployment. The GDP gap is the difference between actual real GDP and potential for full employment real GDP. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gap between actual and potential real GDP measures the monetary losses of real goods and services to the nation from operating at less than full employment. </span></p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1gftjp5f8p9" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Inflation</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation is an increase in the general price level of goods and services in the economy. Deflation is the decrease in the general price level of goods and services in the economy. Inflation is an increase in the overall average level of prices and not an increase in the price of any specific product. The consumer price index measures changes in the average prices of consumer goods and services. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The base year is a year chosen as a reference point for comparison with some earlier or later year. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disinflation is a reduction in the rate of inflation. Nominal income is the actual number of dollars received over a period of time. Real income is the actual number of dollars received adjusted for changes in CPI. People whose nominal income rise faster than the rate of inflation gain purchasing power while people whose nominal incomes do not keep pace with inflation lose purchasing power. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wealth is the value of stock or assets owned at some point in time. Nominal interest rate is the actual interest rate without adjustment for the inflation rate. The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. An adjustable rate mortgage is a home loan that adjusts the nominal interest rate to changes in an index rate, such as rates on treasury securities. When the real rate of interest is negative, lenders and savers lose because interest earned does not keep up with the inflation rate. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyperinflation is an extremely rapid rise in the general price level. Wage price spiral is a situation that occurs when increases in nominal wage rates are passed on in higher prices which result in even higher nominal wage rates and prices. Demand-pull inflation is a rise in the general price level resulting from an excess of total spending. Cost-push inflation is an increase in the general price level resulting from an increase in the cost of production. </span></p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1gftjp5f8pa" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Fiscal Policy</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiscal policy is the use of government spending and taxes to influence the nation’s output, employment, and price level. Discretionary fiscal policy is the deliberate use of changes in government spending or taxes to alter aggregate demand and stabilize the economy.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spending multiplier is the change in aggregate demand resulting from initial change in any component of aggregate expenditures, including consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. In the intermediate segment of the aggregate supply curve, the equilibrium real GDP changes by less than the change in government spending times the spending multiplier. Marginal propensity to consume is the change in consumption spending divided by a given change in income. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any initial change in spending by the government, households, firms, or foreigners on our exports creates a chain reaction of further spending which causes a greater cumulative change in aggregate demand. The marginal propensity to save is the change in saving divided by a change in income. A tax cut has a smaller multiplier effect on aggregate demand than an equal increase in government spending. The tax multiplier is the change in aggregate demand resulting from an initial change in taxes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatic stabilizers are federal expenditures and tax revenues that automatically change levels in order to stabilize an economic expansion or contraction, sometimes referred to as nondiscretionary fiscal policy. Budget surplus is a budget in which government revenues exceed government expenditures in a given time period. A budget deficit is a budget in which government expenditures exceed government revenues in a given time period. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatic stabilizers assist in offsetting a recession when real GDP falls and in offsetting inflation when real GDP expands. Supply-side fiscal policy emphasizes government policies that increase aggregate supply in order to achieve long-run growth in real output, full employment, and a lower price level. A laffer curve is a graph depicting the relationship between tax rates and total tax revenues. </span></p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1gftjp5f8pb" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Money and the Federal Reserve System</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bartering is the direct exchange of one good or service for another good or service, rather than for money. The use of money simplifies and therefore increases market transactions. Money also prevents wasting time that can be devoted to production, thereby promoting economic growth by increasing a nation’s production possibilities. Money is anything that serves as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. Medium of exchange is the primary function of money to be widely accepted in exchange for goods and services.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A unit of account is when the function of money provides a common measurement on the relative value of goods and services. A store of value is the ability of money to hold value over time. Money is a useful mechanism for transforming income in the present into future purchases. Money is the most liquid form of wealth because it can be spent directly in the marketplace. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supply of money must be great enough to meet ordinary transaction needs, but not be so plentiful that it becomes worthless. Commodity money is anything that serves as money while having market value based on the material from which it is made. Fiat money is money accepted by law and not because of its redeemability or tangible value. An item’s ability to serve as money does not depend on its own market value or the backing of precious metal. M1 is the narrowest definition of the money supply. It includes currency and checkable deposits. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currency is money including coins and paper money. Checkable deposits are the total money in financial institutions that can be withdrawn by writing a check. M2 is the definition of the money supply that equals M1 plus near monies such as savings deposits and small time deposits of less than $100,000. M1 money is more liquid than M2 money.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal reserve system is the 12 federal reserve district banks and other financial institutions within each of the federal reserve districts. The board of governors are the seven members appointed by the president and confirmed by the US senate who serve for one nonrenewable 14 year term. Their responsibility is to supervise and control the money supply and the banking system of the United States. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Open Market Committee directs the buying and selling of US government securities which are major instruments for controlling the money supply. The FOMC consists of the seven members of the Board of governors, the president of the New York federal reserve bank, and the presidents of four other Federal reserve district banks.

An economic agent is a person or group that makes choices. Individuals make choices every day. Groups can also make choices.</p><p>The choices that people make are about the allocation of scarce resources. Scarcity exists because people have unlimited desires and the world can not accommodate these desires. So, economics is the study of how everyone allocates their scarce resources.</p><p>We study economics to see what people do and what we should do. The study of what people do is called positive economics. The study of what they should do is normative economics.</p><p>Economics can be further divided into macroeconomics and microeconomics. Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole. The includes subjects like growth rate and inflation rate. Microeconomics is the study of how individuals or small entities make choices. We need to understand this when we want to understand a small piece of the economy.</p><p>The main principles of economics include optimization, equilibrium, and empiricism.</p><p>Optimization is about picking the best available option. Optimizing choices involves trade-offs. to gain one thing, you have to give up another. A budget constraint is therefore the set of things that a person can choose to do without breaking their goals. These choices also involve opportunity costs. This is something that you must give up when you make a choice. To do this, we perform a cost-benefit analysis. This is when we want to compare a set of feasible alternatives and pick the best one. We do this so that we can pick the alternative that has the largest net benefit.</p><p>Equilibrium is when everyone believes that making a change in their behavior is pointless. Everyone is trying to optimize.</p><p>Empiricism is about making choices based on data. We use data to test if theories are correct. People do this to see what is causing things in the world to happen.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The definition of economics states that it is the study of how agents choose to allocate scarce resources and the impact of those resources on society.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement that the United States has too many illegal immigrants is a normative statement since it describes what people ought to do.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement that the United States saw the unemployment rate peak at 10% in 2009 is a positive statement since it describes what people actually do.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ethical implications of a hotly debated governmental policy would best be considered a normative question, since it deals with a subjective issue based on personal preferences.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economics is divided into two broad fields of study: microeconomics and macroeconomics.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microeconomics studies a small piece of the overall economy, while macroeconomics studies the economy as a whole.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policy decisions made by the government are analyzed by both microeconomics and macroeconomics.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A policy such as those limiting a firm’s monopoly powers would be studied under microeconomics, since it deals with a small part of the overall economy. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three principles of economics include optimization, equilibrium, and empiricism.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empiricism describes a situation where economists use data to analyze what is happening in the world.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimization describes a situation where people weigh costs and benefits when making a decision.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equilibrium describes a situation where no one would benefit from changing his or her behavior.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economics, anthropology, psychology, sociology and political science all study human behavior.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists differ from these other social sciences because it also addresses the three key concepts of optimization, equilibrium, and empiricism.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose your new year resolution is to get back into shape. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How would you evaluate your options and choose an optimal one?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do a cost-benefit analysis to compare the alternatives.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When making your decisions about which activity to choose, you should consider the monetary cost as well as the opportunity costs of the activities.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to choose the option that offers the greatest net benefit.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the process of optimization, economists believe that people are considering the feasibility of a choice, given the available information at the time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of optimization for an individual is to maximize overall well being.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose that you allocate $20 each week for your entertainment budget. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This money is spent on two items: either renting movies for $1 each or downloading songs at $1 each.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given this information: which of the following would represent your budget constraint for entertainment?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amount spent on songs plus the amount spent on movies equals $20.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your budget constraint for entertainment illustrates the concepts of tradeoffs, since as you increase your purchases of one item, you must decrease your purchases of the other item.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opportunity cost of an item is a measure of what is given up when you do that activity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s say you are trying to decide on what to do on Friday at 11 am. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You rank your possible options from the one you value the most to the one that you value the least in the following order: going to class, sleeping in late, going to work early, getting lunch, going to the gym, and watching tv.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you decide to go to class, then what do we know about the opportunity cost of your decision?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opportunity cost would be sleeping in late, since it is your next best option.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comparing a set of feasible alternatives and picking the best one is an optimization process called cost-benefit analysis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free riding occurs when people’s private benefits are out of sync with the public interest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which of the following is subject to the free rider problem?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All: neighborhood watch, national security, and public libraries.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which of the following is more susceptible to the free rider problem? Funded symphonies or public roads.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use of public roads is more susceptible since even those who don’t pay taxes still benefit, while government funded symphonies can charge for admission, so that everyone who goes pays their share.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a market to be in equilibrium, three conditions must hold.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount produced by sellers must be equal to the amount purchased by buyers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The costs of making a product must be less than the final price at which the product sells.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buyers must place a value on the uses of a product that is greater than the cost of buying the product.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which of the following is true regarding the concept of causation?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It describes how one event can bring about change in another.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which of the following is not an example of a causal claim?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It rains more often on days you wash your car.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify the cause and effect in the following examples.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower infant mortality is an effect and an improvement in nutrition is the cause.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A surge in cocoa prices is an effect and a pest attack on cocoa crops is the cause.</span></p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1gum5q0ol1nt" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Using Data and Models</strong></span></h2><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">The scientific method is the name for the ongoing process that economists and other scientists use to develop models of the world. Empirical evidence is facts that are obtained through observations and measurement. This is also called data. Economists try to uncover causal relationships among variables. An experiment can be designed to measure a causal relationship. Economists now actively pursue experiments both in the laboratory and in the field. Economists also determine causality by studying historical data that have been generated by a natural experiment.</p><p>A model is a simplified description of reality. Sometimes economists will refer to a model as a theory. These terms are usually used interchangeably. Empirical evidence consists of facts that are obtained through observation and measurement. It is also called data.</p><p>The median value is calculated by ordering the numbers from least to greatest and then finding the value halfway through the list. The mean is the sum of all the different values divided by the number of different values. Causation occurs when one thing directly affects another. A variable is a changing factor.</p><p>Correlation means that two variables tend to change at the same time. Positive correlation implies that two variables tend to move in the same direction. Negative correlation implies that two variables tend to move in opposite directions. When two variables have movements that are not related, we say that the variables have zero correlation. An omitted variable is something that has been left out of a study that would explain why two variables that are in the study are correlated. Reverse causality occurs when we mix up the direction of cause and effect.</p><p>An experiment is a controlled method for investigating causal relationships among variables. Randomization is the assignment of subjects by chance, rather than by choice, to a control group. A natural experiment is an empirical study in which some process has assigned subjects to control and treatment groups in a random or nearly random way.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To say that economists use the scientific method means that they are using an ongoing process to develop models of the world and then test and evaluate those models.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do economists distinguish between models that work and those that don’t?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They test their models against real-world data.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does the sample size affect the validity of an empirical argument?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The larger the sample size the better.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you thought income inequality in the US had increased over time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you expect the ratio of the mean income in the US to the median income to have risen or fallen?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risen, because means change more with extreme values.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you have been hired as a management consultant by a major oil company to help it optimally price gasoline at its service stations. During a meeting with your client, the CEO asks if your economic models include all factors that impact gasoline prices. What is your response?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, the model is a simplified representation of reality.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your client becomes critical of your sloppy technique of using a model that does not include all factors. How do you reply?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic models are meant to be approximations that predict what happens in most circumstances.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is still unconvinced about the reliability of using economic models to make business decisions. You can answer this concern by sharing that you will confirm the accuracy of the model by testing its predictions with empirical data.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is meant by randomization in the context of an economic experiment?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subjects are assigned by chance, rather than by choice, to a group.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the text explains, it can sometimes be very difficult to sort out the direction of causality.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Causation occurs when there is a logical cause and effect relationship.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demonstrate causation or correlation with the following examples.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More police officers and lower crime rates is likely to be causation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More economic growth and higher employment rates is likely to be causation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The length of women’s skirts and stock market performance is likely to be correlated.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The signaling argument implies that a college student who drops out of school one month before graduation should earn much less than a student who graduates.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The human capital argument implies that a college student who drops out of school one month before graduation should earn almost the same as a student who graduates.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your client has asked you to plot crude oil prices and gasoline prices on a graph.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cause, or independent variable, should be plotted on the x-axis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effect, or dependent variable, should be plotted on the y-axis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a positive correlation between oil prices and gasoline prices.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your client has asked you to plot GDP and gasoline prices on a graph.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a negative correlation between GDP and gasoline prices.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you have been hired as a management consultant by a major oil company to help it optimally price gasoline as its service stations.

However, people don’t always make the optimal choice. A large body of economic research attempts to answer the question: when do people succeed in choosing the best feasible option and when do they fail. Using the concept of optimization to describe and predict behavior is an example of positive economic analysis.</p><p>Optimization concepts also provide an excellent toolbox for improving decision making that is not already optimal. Optimization using total value has 3 steps: translate all costs and benefits into common units, calculate the total net benefit of each alternative, and pick the alternative with the highest net benefit.</p><p>Marginal analysis evaluates the change in net benefits when you switch from one alternative to another. Marginal analysis calculates the consequences of doing one more step of something. Marginal cost is the extra cost generated by moving from one alternative to the next alternative. Optimization using marginal analysis has 3 steps: translate all costs and benefits into common units, calculate the marginal consequences of moving between alternatives, and apply the principle of optimization at the margin by choosing the best alternative with the property that moving to it makes you better off and moving away from it makes you worse off.</p><p>Optimization using total value and optimization using marginal analysis yield the same answer.</p><p>Economists refer to the best feasible option as the optimal choice. Behavioral economics jointly analyzes the economic and psychological factors that explain human behavior.</p><p>Marginal analysis is a cost benefit calculation that studies the difference between one feasible alternative and the next feasible alternative. Marginal cost is the extra cost generated by moving from one feasible alternative to the next feasible alternative.</p><p>The principle of optimization at the margin states that an optimal feasible alternative has the property that moving to it makes you better off and moving away from it makes you worse off.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimization is the process that describes the choices that governments make.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimization in levels examines total net benefits, while optimization in differences analyzes the change in net benefits.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have been invited to play a 4-hour round of golf that has a value to you of $90. The total price to play the round of golf is $25.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The net benefit of the round of golf is $65.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now assume that you have a job that pays you $6 per hour. Would you be optimizing to accept the invitation to play golf?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To optimize, you should play golf.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose your total benefit from eating slices of pizza is \(6x-x^{2}\) where x is the number of slices of pizza.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pizza is sold by the slice and costs $2 per slice, and so the total cost of pizza is 2x.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using optimization in levels, what is the optimal(most total benefit) amount of pizza for you to eat?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your net benefit is maximized at 2 slices of pizza.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason why is when x=2, \(6(2)-2^{2} = 12 - 4 = 8\).

If all sellers and all buyers face the same price, it is referred to as the market price. In a perfectly competitive market, sellers all sell an identical good and no one buyer can influence the market. A price-taker is a buyer or seller who accepts the market price. Quantity demanded is the amount of a good that buyers are willing to purchase at a given price. A demand schedule is a table that reports the quantity demanded at different prices, holding all else equal. Holding all else equal implies that everything else in the economy is held constant. The Latin phrase “ceteris paribus” is often used to say this.</p><p>The demand curve plots the quantity demanded at different prices. A demand curve plots the demand schedule. Two variables are negatively related if the variables move in opposite directions. The law of demand is when the quantity demanded rises when price falls. Willingness to pay is the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an extra unit of a good. Diminished marginal benefit: as you consume more of a good, your willingness to pay for an additional unit declines. The process of adding up individual behaviors is referred to as aggregation.</p><p>The market demand curve is the sum of the individual demand curves of all potential buyers. It plots the relationship between the total quantity demanded and the market price, holding all else equal. The demand curve shifts only when the quantity demanded changes at a given price. If a good’s own price changes and its demand curve hasn’t shifted, the own price changes produces a movement along the demand curve.</p><p>For a normal good, an increase in income shifts the demand curve to the right, causing buyers to purchase more of a good. For a normal good, a decrease in income shifts the demand curve to the left, causing all buyers to purchase less of the good. For an inferior good, an increase in income shifts the demand curve to the right, causing buyers to purchase more of the good. For an inferior good, a decrease in income shifts the demand curve to the left, causing buyers to purchase less of the good. Two goods are substitutes when a rise in the price of one leads to a rightward shift in the demand curve for the other. Two goods are complements when a fall in the price of one leads to a rightward shift in the demand curve for the other.</p><p>The quantity supplied is the amount of a good or service that sellers are willing to sell at a given price. A supply schedule is a table that reports the quantity supplied at different prices, holding all else equal. The supply curve plots the quantity supplied at different prices. A supply curve plots the supply schedule. Two variables are positively related if the variables move in the same direction. The law of supply, in almost all cases, is when the quantity supplied rises when the price rises.</p><p>The willingness to accept is the lowest price that a seller is willing to get paid to sell an extra unit of a good. At a particular quantity supplied, willingness to accept is the height of the supply curve. Willingness to accept is the same as the marginal cost of production. The market supply curve is the sum of the individual supply curves of all the potential sellers. It plots the relationship between the total quantity supplied and the market price.</p><p>An input is a good or service used to produce another good or service. The supply curve shifts only when the quantity supplied changes at a given price. If a good’s own price changes and it’s supply curve hasn’t shifted, the own price change produces a movement along the supply curve. The competitive equilibrium is the crossing point of the supply curve and the demand curve. The competitive equilibrium price equates quantity supplied and quantity demanded. The competitive equilibrium quantity is the quantity that corresponds to the competitive equilibrium price.</p><p>When the market price is above the competitive equilibrium price, quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded, creating excess supply. When the market price is below the competitive equilibrium price, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, creating excess demand.</p><p>A market is a group of economic agents who are trading a good or service plus the rules and arrangements for trading. In a perfectly competitive market, sellers all sell an individual good or service and individual buyers or sellers aren’t powerful enough on their own to affect the market price of that good or service.</p><p>Quantity demanded is the amount of a good that buyers are willing to purchase at a given price. A demand schedule is a table that reports the quantity demanded at different prices, holding all else equal. A demand curve plots the demand schedule. The law of demand states that in almost all cases, the quantity demanded rises when the price falls.</p><p>The market demand curve is the sum of the individual demand curves of all potential buyers. The quantity demanded is summed at each price. It plots the relationship between the total quantity demanded and the market price.</p><p>The demand curve shifts only when the quantity demanded changes at a given price. If a good’s own price changes and its demand curve hasn’t shifted, the own price change produces a movement along the demand curve.</p><p>Quantity supplied is the amount of a good or service that sellers are willing to sell at a given price. A supply schedule is a table that reports the quantity supplied at different prices. A supply curve plots the supply schedule. The law of supply states that in almost all cases, the quantity supplied rises when the price rises.</p><p>The market supply curve is the sum of the individual supply curves of all potential sellers. The quantity supplied is summed at each price. It plots the relationship between the total quantity supplied and the market price.</p><p>The supply curve shifts only when the quantity supplied changes at a given price. If a good’s own price changes and its supply curve hasn’t shifted, the own price change produces a movement along the supply curve.</p><p>The competitive equilibrium is the crossing point of the supply curve and the demand curve. The competitive equilibrium price equates quantity supplied and quantity demanded. The competitive equilibrium quantity is the quantity that corresponds to the competitive equilibrium price. When prices are not free to fluctuate, markets fail to equate quantity demanded and quantity supplied.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a perfectly competitive market, sellers cannot charge more than the market price and cannot pay less than the market price.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a perfectly competitive market, if one seller chooses to charge a price for its good that is slightly higher than the market price, then it will lose all or almost all of its customers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market demand is derived by fixing the price and adding up the quantities that each buyer demands.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does the shape of the market demand curve differ from the shape of an individual demand curve?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, they both tend to be downward sloping curves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Law of Demand states that as the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded decreases.

It is calculated by dividing a nation’s aggregate income by the number of people in the country.</p><p>A recession is a period in which aggregate economic output fails. A worker is officially unemployed if he or she does not have a job, has actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks, and is currently available for work. The unemployment rate is the factor of the labor force that is unemployed. National income accounts measure the level of aggregate economic activity in a country. The national income and product accounts is the system of national income accounts that is used by the US government. Gross domestic product is the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a country during a given period of time.</p><p>Two variables are related by an identity when the two variables are defined in a way that makes them mathematically identical. Factors of production are the inputs to the production process.</p><p>Each firm’s value added is the firm’s sales revenue, minus its purchases of intermediate products from other firms.</p><p>Consumption is the market value of consumption goods and consumption services that are bought by domestic households. Investment is the market value of new physical capital that is bought by domestic households and domestic firms. Government expenditure is the market value of government purchases of goods and services. Exports are the market value of all domestically produces goods and services that are purchases by households, firms, and governments in foreign countries. Imports are the market value of all foreign-produced goods and services that are sold to domestic households, domestic firms, and the domestic government. The national income accounting identity, \(Y = C + I G + X - M\), decomposes GDP into consumption + investment + government expenditure + exports - imports.</p><p>Labor income is any form of payment that compensates people for their work. Capital income is any form of payment that derives from owning physical or financial capital.</p><p>Gross national product is the market value of production generated by the factors of production-both capital and labor- possessed or owned by the residents of a particular nation.</p><p>Nominal GDP is the total value of production, using current market prices to determine the value of each unit that is produced. Real GDP is the total value of production using market prices from a specific base year to determine the value of each unit that is produced.</p><p>Real GDP growth is the growth rate of real GDP. The GDP deflator is 100 times the rate of nominal GDP to real GDP in the same year. It is a measure of how prices of goods and services produced in a country have risen since the base year.</p><p>The consumer price index is 100 times the ratio of the cost of buying a basket of consumer goods using target year prices divided by the cost of buying the same basket of consumer goods using base year prices.</p><p>The rate of increase in prices is the inflation rate. It is calculated as the year over year percentage increase in a price index.</p><p>Macroeconomics is the study of economic aggregates and the economy as a whole. An aggregate is a total. Macroeconomic studies total economic activity.</p><p>Gross domestic product is the market value of the final goods and services produced in a country during a particular period of time. GDP is defined in 3 equivalent ways: Production = Expenditure = Income. The circular flow diagram explains these identities and adds a fourth identical way of measuring economic activity: factors of production.</p><p>GDP is just a summary measure of economic activity and economic well being. GDP leaves many details out, including depreciation, home production, the underground economy, externalities, inequality, leisure, and cross-border movements of capital and labor. Nevertheless, residents of countries with relatively high levels of GDP per capita report relatively high levels of life satisfaction.</p><p>Economists distinguish nominal values from real values. Real GDP measures the market value of economic production holding prices fixed at those of a particular base year. The GDP deflator is a measure of the overall level of prices in the economy. The consumer price index is another measure of the overall level of prices. Both the GDP deflator and the CPI can be used to measure the overall rate at which prices are rising: the inflation rate.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which of the following news stories would typically be studied in macroeconomics?</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe inflation should rule monetary policy.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if economic growth is no longer possible?</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expectations high for March employment.</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Production based accounting estimates GDP by computing for each firm the difference between sales revenue and the purchase of intermediate products and then sums this difference across all firms.

Purchasing power parity constructs the cost of a representative basket of commodities in each country and uses these relative costs for comparing income across countries.</p><p>GDP per worker is defined as GDP by the number of people in employment. Productivity refers to the value of goods and services that a worker generates for each hour of work.</p><p>The one dollar a day per person poverty line is a measure of absolute poverty used by economists and other social scientists to compare the extent of poverty across countries.</p><p>Human capital is each person’s stock of skills to produce output or economic value. Physical capital is the stock of all machines and buildings used for production. The physical capital stock of an economy is the value of equipment, structures, and other non-labor inputs used in production. Technology refers to a set of devices and practices that determine how efficiently an economy uses its labor and capital. An aggregate production function describes the relationship between the aggregate GDP of a nation and its factors of production.</p><p>Total efficiency units of labor is the product of the total number of workers in the economy and the average human capital of workers. The law of diminishing marginal product states that the marginal contribution of a factor of production to GDP diminishes when we increase the quantity used of that factor of production.</p><p>Research and development refers to the activities directed at improving scientific knowledge, generating new innovations, or implementing existing knowledge in production to improve the technology of a firm or an economy.</p><p>Efficiency of production refers to the ability of an economy to produce the maximal amount of output from a given amount of factors of production and knowledge.</p><p>GDP per capita, defined as aggregate income divided by total population, varies greatly across countries, with some nations have more than 40 times the GDP per capita of other nations.</p><p>GDP per capita across countries can be compared using exchange rate based measures, which rely on current exchange rates, or purchasing power parity based measures, which compare estimates of the cost of the representative basket of commodities in each country. The latter tend to be more reliable, as they more appropriately capture differences in relative prices across countries and are not subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in exchange rates. Though GDP per capita omits a wealth of other important information on health, schooling, inequality, and poverty, it provides a good summary of prosperity, and higher GDP per capita is typically correlated with higher life expectancy, better schooling, and lower poverty.</p><p>The aggregate production function links the GDP of a nation to its total efficiency units of labor, physical capital stock, technology, and efficiency of production. Greater efficiency units of labor and physical capital, as well as better technology and efficiency of production, increase GDP.</p><p>Though the total efficiency units of labor and physical capital stock matter a great deal for GDP, the most determinant of cross-country differences in GDP per worker appears to be differences in technology and the efficiency of production.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you are comparing the income per capita in the US and Ghana.

Sustained economic growth relies on technological progress. There are sizable differences in the historical growth rates of different economies, which are largely responsible for their differences in the levels of real GDP per capita. Economic growth is a powerful tool for poverty reduction.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic growth is the increase in GDP per capita of an economy. The growth rate is the change in a quantity, for example, real GDP per capita, between two dates, relative to the baseline quantity. Exponential growth refers to a situation in which the growth process can be described by an approximately constant growth rate of a variable such as real GDP or real GDP per capita.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catch-up growth refers to a process whereby relatively poorer nations increase their incomes by taking advantage of knowledge and technologies already invented in other, more technologically advanced countries. Sustained growth refers to a process whereby real GDP per capita grows at a positive and relatively steady rate for long periods of time. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The saving rate designates the fraction of income that is saved. Technological change is the process of new technologies and new goods and services being invented, introduced, and used in the economy, enabling the economy to achieve a higher level of real GDP for given levels of physical capital stock and total efficiency units of labor. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subsistence level is the minimum level of income per person that is generally necessary for the individual to obtaIn enough calories, shelter, and clothing to survive. Fertility refers to the number of children per adult or per woman of childbearing age. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The malthusian cycle refers to the pre-industrial pattern in which increases in aggregate incomes lead to an expanding population, which in turn, reduces income per capita and ultimately puts downward pressure on population. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demographic transition refers to the decline in fertility and number of children per family that many societies undergo as they transform from agriculture to industry. The industrial revolution denotes the series of innovations and their implementation in the production process that began at the end of the eighteenth century in Britain. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many countries, including the United States, have experienced rapid economic growth over the past 200 years, increasing their real GDP per capita several times over. For example, the current real GDP per capita is about 25 times the U.S. real GDP per capita in 1820. In addition, U.S. growth has been relatively sustained, meaning that GDP per capita has grown relatively steady, with the exception of the great depression and the decade following it.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic growth can sometimes take place rapidly due to catch-up growth, whereby relatively poorer nations increase their real GDP per capita by taking advantage of knowledge and technologies already invented in other, more advanced countries.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic growth results from an economy increasing its physical capital, raising the human capital of its workers, and improving its technology. Because of the diminishing marginal product of physical capital and limits of how much each worker can invest in his or her human capital before joining the workforce, sustained growth is generally impossible to achieve just by building up human and physical capital. Rather, the most plausible driver of sustained growth is technological progress. Empirical evidence also suggests that technological progress accounts for the bulk of the increase in real GDP per capita in the United States. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the past 200 years have been characterized by sustained economic growth in many parts of the world, the preceding centuries did not experience steady growth. Instead, most economies during these times experienced Malthusian cycles: increases in GDP fueled population growth, which reduced the standard of living and subsequently acted as a check on further population growth by reducing fertility and survival. The world broke out of the Malthusian cycle through the industrial revolution, which started a process of rapid technological progress, underpinning the sustained growth of the past two centuries.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic growth has the capacity to significantly reduce poverty, provided that such growth is not associated with increased inequality. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catch-up growth is the process by which relatively poorer nations increase their incomes by taking advantage of the knowledge and technologies already invented in other technologically advanced nations.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of catch up growth is South Korea, which by 1970 had become poorer relative to the US, but over the last 40 years grew faster than the US, closing the gap that had opened up previously.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sustained growth is the process where GDP per capita grows at a positive and relatively steady rate for long periods of time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of sustained growth is the US, which demonstrated sustained growth between 1820 and 2007.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growth equation is defined as:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(Growth = \frac{Y_{t+1} - Y_t}{Y_t}\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the equation for sustained growth above, explain why a country that has a very low per capita GDP can also have a very high growth rate.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A country with a very low per capita GDP can have a very high growth rate because mathematically, when the denominator is lower, even a small difference in the numerator will result in a large growth rate.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider a $100 increase in GDP per capita. In 2012 Niger had a GDP per capita of approximately $800, and the US had a GDP per capita of $50700. Calculate the corresponding growth rates for these two countries.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niger’s growth rate is 12.50 percent. The US growth rate is .20 percent.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, niger started out with a lower base and had a higher growth rate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The saving rate in an economy is defined as the fraction of total income that households save.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factors that help household decide whether to consume or save their incomes are:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest rate</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expectations about taxes</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expectations of future income growth</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Household saving decisions impact investment in the economy by having a direct impact on investment, as saving is correlated with investment. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which factors explain economic growth in the US over the past few decades?</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human capital</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical capital</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which factor is the most important contributor to growth in the US?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A relatively simple method of gauging the change in living standards over time with a country is to compute real GDP per capita.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is done by dividing each value of real GDP by the associated population.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real GDP per capita in 2018 =  18437100000000 / 327667595 = 56268</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real GDP per capita in 2023 =  20246400000000 / 336047315 = 60249</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From 2018 to 2023 real GDP per capita increased at an average annual rate of 1.38%.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the rule of 70, the growth rate computed above, if maintained, would result in a doubling of real GDP per capita in 50.7 years.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gross government saving reflects the status of the budget; a deficit is negative saving by government while a surplus is positive government saving.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why was there no sustained economic growth before modern times, that is, before 1800?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The period before modern times was not stagnant, but it was not characterized by sustained growth. One of the possible explanations is the fact that the pace of technological change was much slower than in more recent times. Also, any increases in aggregate income were offset by increases in population, keeping per capita income low.</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increases in aggregate income were offset by increases in population, keeping per capita income low.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pace of technological change was much slower than in modern times.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no sustained growth in living standards prior to the industrial revolution because:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With output increasing at a decreasing rate, it is not possible to increase living standards, especially as the population continues to grow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The industrial revolution had a positive impact on living standards:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the introduction of new capital and technology that shifted the production curve upward.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that output increases at a decreasing rate, as is also the case with capital. This does not allow for an increase in living standards, especially as the population continues to grow.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before 1800, a pattern developed showing that increases in aggregate income led to an expanding population, which in turn reduced income per capita and put downward pressure on the population. The pattern is known as the Malthusian cycle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Malthusian cycle was common prior to the Industrial Revolution.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What factors explain the dramatic increases in life expectancy that we saw in most countries in the twentieth century?</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientific breakthrough leading to the development of antibiotics and vaccines</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovations in disease control, including the use of DDT against malaria</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The establishment of simple but effective medical and public health practices</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assume a society consists of two economic groups: one group is rich and the other group is poor.

They also erect significant entry barriers into businesses and occupations.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political institutions are the aspects of the society’s rules that concern the allocation of political power and the constraints on the exercise of political power. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creative destruction refers to the process by which new technologies replace older ones, new businesses replace established companies, and new skills make old ones redundant.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political creative destruction refers to the process by which economic growth destabilizes economic regimes and reduces the political power of rulers.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical capital, human capital, and technology are proximate causes of prosperity in the sense that, though they determine whether a nation is prosperous, they are themselves determined by other, deeper factors. Put differently, if we want to understand why some nations are poor, we have to ask why they do not sufficiently invest in physical capital or human capital and why they do not adopt the best technologies and organize their production efficiently. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fundamental causes of prosperity include factors that potentially influence the physical and human capital investment and technologies of nations and, via this channel, shape their prosperity.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three leading hypotheses about the fundamental causes of prosperity are geography, culture, and institutions. According to the geography hypothesis, geographic aspects determine whether a nation can be prosperous. According to the culture hypothesis, it is the cultural values of the country’s people that powerfully determine its potential for prosperity. According to the institution's hypothesis, it is the institutions that are central to prosperity.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inclusive economic institutions are those that provide secure property rights, establish a judiciary system that allows and facilitates private contracting and financial transactions, and maintain relatively free entry into different businesses and occupations. In contrast, extractive economic institutions create insecure property rights, a partial judicial system, and entry barriers that protect the businesses and incomes of a small segment of society at the expense of the rest. According to the institution's hypothesis, inclusive economic institutions tend to generate prosperity, while extractive economic institutions do not.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the inequalities in GDP per capita around the world have multiple causes, the evidence from the economic experiences of former European colonies suggests that institutional factors, and not geography, are central to explaining these disparities. In fact, the major patterns cannot be explained by geographic factors.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foreign aid can be useful to temporarily alleviate extreme poverty or manage crises but is unlikely to be a solution to poor economic development in many parts of the world.

The value of the marginal product of labor is also the labor demand curve because they both show how the quantity of labor demanded varies with the wage.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The labor supply curve represents the relationship between the quantity of labor supplied and the wage.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The competitive equilibrium wage is the market clearing wage. At this wage, every worker who wants a job can find one: the quantity of labor demanded matches the quantity of labor supplied.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Job search refers to the activities that workers undertake to find appropriate jobs.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frictional unemployment refers to the unemployment that arises because workers have imperfect information about available jobs and need to engage in a time consuming process of job search.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wage rigidity refers to the condition in which the market wage is held above the competitive equilibrium level that would clear the labor market.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structural unemployment arises when the quantity of labor supplied persistently exceeds the quantity of labor demanded. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collective bargaining refers to the contract between firms and labor unions.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efficiency wages are wages above the lowest pay that workers would accept: employers use them to increase motivation and productivity. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downward wage rigidity arises when workers resist a cut in their wage and firms respond to this resistance by holding nominal wages fixed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The natural rate of unemployment is the rate of unemployment around which a healthy economy fluctuates.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long run rate of unemployment is the average historical rate of unemployment.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyclical unemployment is the deviation of the actual unemployment rate from the long run rate of unemployment.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potential workers are defined as the civilian non-institutional population ages 16 and older. Those holding a paid full time or part time job are classified as employed, while those without a paid job who have actively looked for work are unemployed. Potential workers who are employed and unemployed make up the labor force, while the rest of the potential workers are classified as out of the labor force. The unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unemployment rate fluctuates significantly over time. It is higher during and in the immediate aftermath of recessions.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employment is determined by labor demand and labor supply. The labor demand curve is downward-sloping because of the diminishing marginal product of labor and profit maximization by firms. In contrast, the labor supply curve tends to be upward-sloping because higher wages generally encourage workers to supply even more hours to the labor market.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The competitive labor market equilibrium is given by the intersection of the labor demand and labor supply curves. The competitive equilibrium wage is also called the market clearing wage.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a competitive labor market equilibrium in which all workers know the market clearing wage, there will be very little unemployment because every worker willing to work at the market clearing wage can find a job. Workers who are not willing to work at the market clearing wage will stop searching and will therefore not be counted as unemployed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frictional unemployment exists because workers need time to learn about the condition of the labrador market, and search for a job that suits them. Even in a healthy labor market, there will always be some unemployed workers in the process of changing jobs, or finding a new job after losing their previous one, or finding their first job after entry into the labor market.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structural unemployment results when the market wage is above the market clearing level, causing the quantity of labor supplied to be greater than the quantity of labor demanded. This is often referred to as wage rigidity. It can result from institutional features of the labor market like minimum wage legislation or collective bargaining. More importantly, it can result from efficiency wages or from downward wage rigidity. Efficiency wages arise when employers pay wages higher than the market clearing wage to increase worker productivity. Downward wage rigidity arises because of the unwillingness of workers to accept wage cuts, which prevents wages from immediately falling in response to a leftward shift of the labor demand curve.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important cause of unemployment fluctuations is a shifting labor demand curve. When wages are flexible, a shift to the left of the labor demand curve reduces both employment and wages but does not increase unemployment because the labor market clears. When wages are rigid, the same leftward shift creates a larger decline in employment because the wage does not decline and unemployment increases.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The natural state of unemployment is the rate of unemployment around which a healthy economy fluctuates. The long run rate of unemployment is the average historical rate of unemployment, which tends to be higher than the natural rate of unemployment due to the presence of structural unemployment. Cyclical unemployment is the difference between the current rate of unemployment and the long run rate of unemployment. Cyclical unemployment is positive in recessions and negative in economic booms. </span></p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1gvpbluvk20l" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Credit Markets</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The credit market matches borrowers and savers.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The credit market equilibrium determines the real interest rates.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks and other financial intermediaries have three key functions: identifying profitable lending opportunities, using short run deposits to make long run investments, and managing the amount and distribution of risk.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks become insolvent when the value of their liabilities exceeds the values of their assets.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debtors, or borrowers, are economic agents who borrow funds.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit refers to the loans that the debtor receives.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interest rate is the annual cost of a 1$ loan.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The credit demand curve is the schedule that reports the relationship between the quantity of credit demanded and the real interest rate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The credit supply curve is the schedule that reports the relationship between the quantity of credit supplied and the real interest rate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The credit market is where borrowers obtain funds from savers.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Securities are financial contracts.

Credit allows firms to borrow for investment or households to borrow to purchase a home.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relevant price in the credit market is the real interest rate rather than the nominal interest rate. The real interest rate adjusts the price of borrowing or lending for the effects of inflation, thus reflecting the economic trade-off between the present or the future that borrowers and savers face.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firms, households, and governments use the credit market for borrowing. The credit demand curve summarizes the relationship between the quantity of credit demanded by borrowers and the real interest rate. The credit demand curve results from the optimizing behavior of these borrowers.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The credit supply curve summarizes the relationship between the quantity of credit supplied and the real interest rate and also results from optimizing behavior, this time of savers. Savers trade off consumption today for consumption in the future, taking into account the reward for delaying consumption-the real interest rate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intersection of the credit demand curve and the credit supply curve is the credit market equilibrium. At the equilibrium real interest rate, the quantity of credit demanded is equal to the quantity of credit supplied.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saving and borrowing in the credit market are intermediated by banks and other financial intermediaries. Banks play three key roles in the economy. They find credit worth borrowers and channel savings of depositors to them. They transform the maturity structure in the economy by collecting money from savers in the form of short term demand deposits and investing money in long term projects. They manage risk by holding a diversified portfolio and by transferring risk from depositors to stockholders.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governments provide deposit insurance that reduces the likelihood of bank runs, and governments intervene to save failing banks in order to avert widespread crises. The US economy has experienced four major waves of bank failures since 1900. </span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1gvsn23mr20s" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Monetary System</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money has three key roles: serving as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quantity theory of money describes the relationships among the money supply, velocity, prices, and real GDP.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve, the US central bank, has a dual mandate-low inflation and maximum employment.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal reserve holds the reserves of private banks.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve’s management of private bank reserves enables the Fed to do three things: set a key short term interest rate, influence the money supply and the interest rate, and influence the long term real interest rate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money is the asset that people use to make and receive payments when buying and selling goods and services.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A medium of exchange is an asset that can be traded for goods and services.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A store of value is an asset that enables people to transfer purchasing power into the future.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A unit of account is a universal yardstick that is used for expressing the worth of different goods and services.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiat money refers to something that is used as legal tender by government decree and is not backed by a physical commodity like gold or silver.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The money supply adds together currency in circulation, checking accounts, saving accounts, travelers’ checks, and money market accounts. It is sometimes referred to as M2.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quantity theory of money assumes that the growth rate of the money supply and the growth rate of the nominal GDP are the same over the long run.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deflation rate is the rate of decrease of a price index.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government revenue obtained from printing currency is called seigniorage.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real wage is the nominal wage divided by a price index, like the consumer price index.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The central bank is the government institution that monitors financial institutions, controls key interest rates, and indirectly controls the money supply. The activities constitute monetary policy.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve bank is the name of the central bank in the US.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liquidity refers to funds available for immediate repayment. To express the same concept in a slightly different way, funds are liquid if they are immediately available for payment.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal funds market refers to the market where banks obtain overnight loans of reserves from one another.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans in the federal funds market. The funds being lent are reserves at the Federal Reserve Bank.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private banks that hold reserves at the Federal Reserve, including reserves that they have borrowed, are paid interest on those hold reserves. This is called interest on reserves, and this interest rate is set by the Federal Reserve.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point where the supply and demand curves cross in the federal funds market is the federal funds market equilibrium. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Federal Reserve wishes to increase the level of reserves that private banks hold, it offers to buy government bonds from the private banks, and in return it gives the private banks more electronic reserves. If the Federal Reserve wishes to decrease the level of reserves, it offers to sell government bonds to the private banks and in return the private banks give back some of their reserves. By buying or selling government bonds, the Federal Reserve shifts the vertical supply curve in the federal funds market and thereby controls the level of reserves. These transactions are referred to as open market transactions.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long term real interest rate is the long term nominal interest rate minus the long term inflation rate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The realized real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the realized rate of inflation.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expected real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the expected rate of inflation.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic agents’ inflation expectations are their beliefs about future inflation rates.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money plays a vital role in our lives. It makes a range of economic transactions possible, simultaneously serving as a medium of exchange that can be traded for goods and services, a store of value that enables us to save and transfer purchasing power into the future, and a common unit of account that expresses the price of different goods and services. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The money supply is the quantity of money that individuals can immediately use in transactions. The money supply is defined as the sum of currency in circulation and the balances of most bank accounts at private banks. This measure of the money supply is referred to as M2. This measure excludes all forms of bank reserves. Specifically, the money supply excludes bank reserves of private banks on deposit at the Federal Reserve.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quantity theory of money links the money supply to nominal GDP, which is the value of total output in the economy measured at current prices. The quantity theory of money implies that the long term inflation rate equals the long run growth rate of the money supply minus the long run growth rate of real GDP.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a fixed growth rate of real GDP, faster growth of the money supply leads to inflation and hyperinflation. Inflationary growth in the money supply generates social costs that firms incur as they make frequent price changes and price controls that create supply disruptions, shortages, and inefficient queuing. Moderate growth in the money supply generates certain benefits for society including seigniorage. Moderate inflation also enables employers to lower real wages without cutting nominal wages. Moderate inflation also makes it easier for the Federal Reserve to lower the real interest rate. Lower real wages and lower real interest rates stimulate growth of real GDP.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve bank in the US, attempt to keep inflation at a low and stable level and also try to maximize the sustainable level of employment.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve regulates banks, implements interbank payments, and attempts to influence macroeconomic fluctuations.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve holds the reserve of private banks. The management of these private bank reserves is one of the most important roles that the Federal Reserve plays. It’s management of private bank reserves enables it to influence interest rates, the inflation rate, and the level of employment.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve has many policy levers that enable it to influence the market for bank reserves, the federal funds rate, including shifting the quantity of reserves supplied, which is referred to as open market operations and changing the interest on reserves which shifts the demand curve for reserves.</span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1gvv9ku5v213" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Short-Run Fluctuations</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recessions are periods in which real GDP falls.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic fluctuations have three key features; co-movement, limited predictability, and persistence.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic fluctuations occur because of technology shocks, changing sentiments, and monetary factors.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic shocks are amplified by downward wage rigidity and multipliers.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic booms are periods of expansions of GDP, associated with increasing employment and declining unemployment.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three key factors contributed to the 2007-2009 recession: a collapsing housing bubble, fall in household wealth, and a financial crisis. The recession was accompanied by both a demand shock and a financial shock.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One key factor initiated the 2020 recession: a coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic led consumers to reduce their demand for goods and services because of both their concerns about their own household finances and their effort to avoid being infected by the coronavirus. The pandemic led firms to cut back their activities, both because consumers were reducing demand for goods and services and because firms found it costly or even impossible to operate safely during the pandemic.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short run changes in the growth of GDP are referred to as economic fluctuations or business cycles.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic expansions are the periods between recessions. Accordingly, an economic expansion begins at the end of one recession and continues until the start of the next recession.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Depression refers to the severe contraction that started in 1929, reaching a low point for real GDP in 1933. The period of below trend real GDP did not end until the buildup to World War II in the late 1930’s. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there is no consensus on the definition, the term depression is typically used to describe a prolonged recession with an unemployment rate of 20 percent or more.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real business cycle theory is the school of thought that emphasizes the role of changes in technology in causing economic fluctuations.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Animal spirits are psychological factors that lead to changes in the mood of consumers or businesses, thereby affecting consumption, investment and GDP.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sentiments include changes in expectations about future economic activity, changes in uncertainty facing firms and households, and fluctuations in animal spirits. Changes in sentiments lead to changes in household consumption and firm investment.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multipliers are economic mechanisms that amplify the initial impact of a shock.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A self-fulfilling prophecy is a situation in which the expectations of an event induce actions that lead to that event.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aggregate demand is the economy’s overall demand for the goods and services that firms produce. Aggregate demand derives the hiring decisions of firms and consequently determines the labor demand curve.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actual wages are also called nominal wages, which distinguishes them from wages adjusted for inflation, or real wages. To calculate real wages, economists divide nominal wages by a measure of overall prices.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The phillips curve describes the empirical relationship between employment growth and inflation, showing that employment growth tends to produce more inflation, especially when an economy is near full employment.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All economies experience economic fluctuations. The growth rate of GDP fluctuates from year to year. During recessions, real GDP contracts and unemployment increases. On rare occasions, a recession turns into a depression, like the great depression. From 1929 to 1933, real GDP declined by 26 percent, and the rate of unemployment rose from 3 percent to 25 percent. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic fluctuations have three key properties. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-movement is when consumption, investment, GDP, and employment generally fall and rise together. Unemployment moves in the opposite direction. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limited predictability of turning points: Economic fluctuations are not pendulum-like with regular up and down cycles. It is difficult to predict in advance when an economy will enter a recession and when a recession will end. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Persistence: When the economy is growing, it will probably keep going the following quarter. Likewise, when the economy is contracting-when growth is negative-the economy will probably keep contracting the following quarter.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the labor demand curve shifts to the left, employment and real GDP fall. When the labor demand curve shifts to the right, employment and real GDP rise.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many factors explain fluctuations in economic activity.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology shocks: Changes’ in firms productivity translate into shifts in the demand curve for labor, causing fluctuations in employment and real GDP. The recession of 2020 was caused by the covid-19 pandemic, which is an example of a productivity shock.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keynesian factors: Changes in sentiments, including changes in expectations, uncertainty, and animal spirits, influence firm and household behavior. If a firm becomes pessimistic, its demand curve for labor shifts to the left. If a firms’ customers become pessimistic, they reduce their purchases, decreasing demand for the firm’s products and shifting the firm's labor demand curve to the left. An initial shift in the labor demand curve creates a cascading chain of events, multiplying or amplifying the impact of the initial shock. For example, when firms lay off workers in response to a shock, the laid off workers cut their own consumption, reducing the demand for the products of other firms. Financial factors create additional multiplier effects. Defaults, bankruptcies, and declines in asset prices lead banks to scale back their lending to firms and households, generating another round of adverse shifts in the labor demand curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monetary and financial factors: A fall in the price level is contractionary because firms face downward wage rigidities-that is, they are unable or unwilling to cut wages. Employment declines by more than it would have with flexible wages. In addition, monetary contractions cause the real interest rate to rise, reducing investment. Finally, financial crises reduce the credit available to firms and households. All these channels will shift the labor demand curve to the left, reducing employment and real GDP.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic booms tend to increase employment and reduce unemployment as the labor demand curve of the economy shifts to the right and the multiplier effects increase employment further. Economic expansions may generate inflation if the economy is already near the level of full employment. Economic booms also have a dark side because if they reverse, the economy can overshoot and sink into a recession.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiplier effects help us understand the recession of 2007-2009. Between the late 1990’s and 2006, the US housing market experienced a bubble. This bubble burst in 2006, and real housing prices fell by approximately 40 percent. The construction industry, which had been booming until then, began a sharp contraction. Falling housing prices-and by implication falling wealth-led households to cut their consumption. Firms, seeing the demand for their products decline, reduced their labor demand, starting a spiral of layoffs and further reductions in household consumption. The collapse in housing prices also led to mortgage defaults and foreclosures. The defaults and foreclosures generated huge losses for many banks, which either failed or sharply cut lending, further worsening the recession.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recession of 2020 was caused by the covid-19 pandemic, which reduced the productivity of economic exchange. Because of the risk of infection,households were less willing to demand goods and services, and many industries could not both profitably and safely supply goods and services. The first documented US infection occurred in January 2020. The US recession and stock market crash started in February, anticipating an initial large wave of infections and deaths from March to May. During this first wave of infections, large parts of the economy closed down, causing a leftward shift in the demand for labor and a spike in unemployment that was far sharper than any previously recorded in US history. The unemployment rate peaked at 14.8 percent in April, only two months after the recession started. Once the first wave of infections began to decline, many people returned to work, though the virus was still not under control. The US unemployment rate began to fall in May, just three months after the recession started.</span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1h016qhuh21a" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Countercyclical Macroeconomic Policies</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countercyclical policies attempt to reduce the severity of economic fluctuations and smooth the growth rates of employment, GDP, and prices.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countercyclical monetary policy reduces economic fluctuations by manipulating bank reserves and interest rates.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expansionary monetary policy increases bank reserves and decreases interest rates.

Crowding out occurs when rising government expenditure partially or even fully displaces expenditures by households and firms.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countercyclical fiscal policy uses lower government spending and higher taxes to reduce GDP, shifting the labor demand curve to the left.</span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1h03gjmm822o" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Macroeconomics and International Trade</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">International trade enables countries to focus on activities in which they have a competitive advantage.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current account includes international flows from exports, imports, factor payments, and transfers.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a country runs a current account deficit, it pays for this by giving its trading partners financial IOUs.If a country runs a current account surplus, it receives financial IOUs from its trading partners.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world has become more globalized over the past several decades.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gains from specialization are the economic gains that society can obtain by having some individuals, regions, or countries specialize in the production of certain goods and services. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A producer has an absolute advantage in producing a good or service if the producer can produce more units per hour than other producers can.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A producer has a comparative advantage in producing a good or service when the producer has a lower opportunity cost per unit produced compared to other producers.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A closed economy does not trade with the rest of the world.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An open economy trades freely with the rest of the world.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net exports are the value of a country’s exports minus the value of its imports. Net exports are also known as the trade balance.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A trade surplus is an excess of exports over imports and is thus the name given to the trade balance when it is positive.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A trade deficit is an excess of imports and is thus the name given to the trade balance when it is negative.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current account is the sum of net exports, net factor payments from abroad, and net transfers from abroad.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financial account is the increase in domestic assets held by foreigners minus the increase  in foreign assets held domestically.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net capital outflows are the difference between investment by the home country in foreign countries and foreign investment in the home country. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foreign direct investment refers to investments by foreign individuals and companies in domestic firms and businesses. To qualify as foreign direct investment, these flows need to generate a large foreign ownership stake in the domestic business. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of globalization has produced a highly interconnected world.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">International trade enables us to exploit specialization and comparative advantage. Comparative advantage arises when a person or country has a lower opportunity cost of production than another person or country.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globalization and international trade improve the well-being of most people, but many other people are made worse off, especially low-skilled workers in developed countries who lose their jobs to foreign producers.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A country runs a current account deficit when it has a negative sum of net exports, net payments from abroad for factor payments, and net transfers from abroad. When this happens, there needs to be a corresponding flow of funds in the financial account that pays for the current account deficit. This implied a net increase in domestic assets held by foreigners and a net increase in foreign assets by domestic residents.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rapid process of globalization has been under way for several decades, increasing the total volume of international trade. Consequently, consumers and workers around the world can now take better advantage of the gains from international trade. Nevertheless, continued progress in globalization is not guaranteed. In fact, an anti-globalization backlash is now occurring, and some trade agreements have been abandoned or renegotiated. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globalization also makes the enormous inequities across nations more visible. We purchase goods and services produced and assembled by workers, sometimes even children, earning a small fraction of the wages of workers in developed countries. The working conditions in factories in the developing world are far worse than those of most low paid factory workers in foreign countries. Their alternative opportunities for employment are usually worse than these factory jobs in the traded goods sector.</span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1h05qmdgv231" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Open Economy Macroeconomics</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nominal exchange rate is the rate at which one country’s currency can be exchanged for the currency of another country.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a flexible exchange rate system, the nominal exchange rate is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixed or managed exchange rates are controlled by the government.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real exchange rate is the ratio of the prices of a basket of goods and services in two countries and thus influences net exports from one country to the other.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A decline in net exports reduces labor demand, lowers GDP, and causes unemployment.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nominal exchange rate is the price of one country’s currency in units of another country’s currency.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the government does not intervene in the foreign exchange market, then the country has a flexible exchange rate, which is also referred to as a floating exchange rate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the government fixes a value for the exchange rate and intervenes to maintain that value, then the country has a fixed exchange rate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the government intervenes actively to influence the exchange rate, then the country has a managed exchange rate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real exchange rate is defined as the ratio of the dollar price of a basket of goods and services in the US, divided by the dollar price of the same basket of goods and services in a foreign country.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nominal exchange rate is the number of units of foreign currency per unit of domestic currency. The real exchange rate, in contrast, gives the ratio of the dollar price of a basket of goods and services purchased in the US to the dollar price of the same basket purchased in a foreign country.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nominal exchange rate is determined by the supply and demand for a currency in the foreign exchange market. When a Chinese producer sells goods to a US firm and receives dollars, the Chinese firm converts the dollars to the Chinese currency in the foreign exchange market. This is equivalent to demanding yuan and supplying dollars in the foreign exchange market. In contrast, a Chinese firm that imports from the US would be doing the opposite in the foreign exchange market: supplying yuan and demanding dollars with which it will pay its US trading partners.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a country has a flexible exchange rate, changes in the supply and demand for a currency lead to fluctuations in the nominal exchange rate. Many countries, however, manage or fix exchange rates and therefore peg their currencies to another currency, such as the dollar. Under managed or fixed exchange rates, fluctuations in the supply and demand for the currency do not necessarily lead to corresponding fluctuations in the exchange rate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though managed or fixed exchange rate systems might appear more stable at first, when the exchange rates they generate are out of line with market forces, these systems can lead to sudden changes in the exchange rate. In the process, they create huge profit opportunities, like the one exploited by the financier George Soros in 1992, when he bet that the British pound would be allowed to depreciate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real exchange rate is a key price for the economy in part because it determines net exports. A real exchange rate greater than 1 implies that US goods and services are more expensive than foreign goods and services. Thus, a real exchange rate above 1 discourages exports and encourages imports, reducing net exports.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fall in net exports lowers GDP and shifts the labor demand curve to the left.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domestic interest rates influence the real exchange rate. A fall in domestic interest rates reduces the appeal of domestic assets to investors, lowering both nominal and the real exchange rates. The resulting rise in net exports shifts the labor demand curve to the right and increases GDP.</span></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 16, 2023</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://aindien.com/economics/">Economics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Feconomics-essentials.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Feconomics-essentials.html&amp;via=_Aindien&amp;text=Economics%20Essentials" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://aindien.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://aindien.com/basics-of-the-cardano-coin.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Basics of the Cardano Coin</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://aindien.com/pictures-not-showing-in-chrome.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Pictures Not Showing In Chrome </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-05-07T22:37" class="feed__date">May 7, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/monetary-system-in-economics.html" class="invert">Monetary System in Economics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-05-06T15:20" class="feed__date">May 6, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/credit-markets-in-economics.html" class="invert">Credit Markets In Economics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-04-23T18:50" class="feed__date">April 23, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/demand-and-supply-in-economics.html" class="invert">Demand and Supply in Economics</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><style type="text/css">#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }
