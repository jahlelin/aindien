Scarcity is when human wants are greater than the available supply of time, goods, and resources. The problems of scarcity and choice are basic economic problems faced by every society. Resources are the basic categories of inputs used to produce goods and services. Land is any natural resource provided by nature that is used to produce a good or service. Labor is the mental and physical capacity of workers to produce goods and services. Entrepreneurship is the creative ability of individuals to seek profits by taking risks and combining resources to produce innovative products.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital is a human-made good used to produce other goods and services. Money by itself does not produce goods and services. It is only a means to facilitate the purchase and sale of resources and consumer goods. Economics is therefore the study of how society chooses to allocate its scarce resources to the production of goods and services to satisfy unlimited wants. Macroeconomics is the branch of economics that studies decision making for the economy as a whole. Microeconomics is the branch that studies decision making by a single individual, household, firm, industry, or level of government. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A model is a simplified description of reality used to understand and predict the relationship between variables. Ceteris paribus is a Latin phrase that means while certain things change, all other things remain unchanged. A theory cannot be tested legitimately unless its ceteris paribus assumption is satisfied. The fact that one event follows another does not necessarily mean that the first event caused the second event. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive economics is an analysis limited to statements that are verifiable. Economists’ forecasts can differ because using the same methodology, economists can agree that event X causes event Y, but disagree over the assumption that event X will occur. Normative economics is an analysis based on subjective value judgements. When opinions or points of view are not based on facts, they are scientifically untestable. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A direct relationship is a positive association between two variables. When one variable increases, the other variable increases. Also, when one variable decreases, the other variable decreases. An inverse relationship is a negative association between two variables. When one variable decreases, the other also decreases. The slope of a graph is the ratio of the change in the variable on the vertical axis to the change in the variable on the horizontal axis. An independent relationship means a zero association between two variables. When one variable changes, the other variable remains unchanged.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A shift in a curve occurs only when the ceteris paribus assumption is relaxed and a third variable not shown on either axis of the graph is allowed to change. </span></p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ggd05lhp2jo" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Production Possibilities</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opportunity cost is the best alternative sacrificed for a chosen alternative. Marginal analysis is an examination of the effects of additions or subtractions from a current situation. The production possibilities curve shows the maximum combinations of two outputs an economy can produce in a given period of time with its available resources and technology. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology is the body of knowledge applied to how goods are produced. Scarcity limits an economy to points on or below its production possibilities curve. The production possibilities curve consists of all efficient output combinations at which an economy can produce more of one good only by producing less of the other good. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law of increasing opportunity costs is the principle that the opportunity cost increases as production of one output expands. Because resources are not equally well -suited to producing all products, it is common to experience increasing opportunity costs and a bowed-out production possibilities curve. Economic growth is the ability of an economy to produce greater levels of output, represented by an outward shift of its production possibilities curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An investment is the accumulation of capital, such as factories, machines, and inventories, used to produce goods and services. A nation can accelerate economic growth by increasing its production of capital goods in excess of the capital being worn out in the production process. </span></p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ggd05lhp2jp" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Demand and Supply</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law of demand is the principle that there is an inverse relationship between the price of a good and the quantity buyers are willing to purchase in a defined time period. A demand curve shows the various quantities of product consumers are willing to purchase at possible prices during a specified period of time. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A change in quantity demanded is a movement between points along a stationary demand curve. The change in demand is an increase or decrease in the quantity demanded at each possible price. An increase in demand is a rightward shift in the entire demand curve. A decrease in demand is a leftward shift in the entire demand curve. Under the law of demand, any decrease in price along the vertical axis will cause an increase in quantity demanded, measured along the horizontal axis, and appears as a movement along the demand curve. Changes in non-price determinants can produce only a shift in the demand curve and not a movement along the demand curve.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A normal good is any good for which there is a direct relationship between changes in income and its demand curve. An inferior good is any good for which there is an inverse relationship between changes in income and its demand curve. A substitute good is one that competes with another good for consumer purchases. As a result, there is a direct relationship between a price change for one good and the demand for its competitor good. The complementary good is a good that is jointly consumed with another good. As a result, there is an inverse relationship between a price change for one good and the demand for its “go together” good. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law of supply is the principle that there is a direct relationship between the price of a good and the quantity sellers are willing to offer for sale in a defined time period. The supply curve shows the various quantities of a product sellers are willing to produce and offer for sale at possible prices during a specified time period.  Only at a higher price will it be profitable for sellers to incur the higher opportunity cost associated with producing and supplying a larger quantity. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change in quantity supplied is a movement between points along a stationary supply curve. Under the law of supply, any increase in price along the vertical axis will cause an increase in the quantity supplied, measured along the horizontal axis, and appears as a movement along the supply curve. A change in supply is an increase or decrease in the quantity supplied at each possible price. An increase in supply is a rightward shift in the entire supply curve. A decrease in supply is a leftward shift in the entire supply curve. Changes in non-price determinants can produce only a shift in the supply curve and not a movement along the supply curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A market is any arrangement in which buyers and sellers interact to determine the price and quantity of goods and services exchanged. A surplus is a market condition existing at any price where the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded. A shortage is a market condition existing at any price where the quantity supplied is less than the quantity demanded. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The equilibrium is a market condition that occurs at any price and quantity at which the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal. Graphically, the intersection of the supply curve and the demand curve is the market equilibrium price-quantity point. When all other non-price factors are held constant, this is the only stable coordinate on the graph. A price system is a mechanism that uses the forces of supply and demand to create an equilibrium through rising and falling prices. </span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ggd05lhp2jq" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>The Markets</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price ceiling in a market is a legally established maximum price a seller can charge. Conversely, a price floor is a legally established minimum price a seller can be paid. A price ceiling or price floor prevents market adjustment in which competition among buyers and sellers bids the price upward or downward to the equilibrium price. A market failure in which market equilibrium results in too few or too many resources being used in the production of a good or service. This inefficiency may justify government intervention. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An externality is a cost or benefit imposed on people other than the consumers and producers of a good or service. When the supply curve fails to include external costs, the equilibrium price is artificially low, and the equilibrium quantity is artificially high. External costs cause the market to overallocate resources. Then, when the demand curve fails to include external benefits the equilibrium price is artificially low, and the equilibrium quantity is artificially low. External benefits cause the market to underallocate resources. A public good has two properties. Users collectively consume benefits and there is no way to bar people who do not pay from consuming the good or service. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If public goods are available only in the marketplace, people wait for someone else to pay, and the result is an underproduction or zero production of public goods.</span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ggsqc11p41u" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Price Elasticity of Demand</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price elasticity of demand is the ratio of the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a product to a percentage change in its price. Elastic demand is a condition in which the percentage change in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage change in price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total revenue is the number of dollars a firm earns from the sale of a good or service, which is equal to its price multiplied by the quantity demanded.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inelastic demand is a condition in which the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price. Unitary elastic demand is a condition in which the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price. Perfectly elastic demand is a condition in which a small percentage change in price brings about an infinite percentage change in quantity demanded. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfectly inelastic demand is a condition in which the quantity demanded does not change as the price changes.  The price elasticity coefficient of demand applies only to a specific range of prices. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price elasticity coefficient of demand is directly related to the availability of suitable substitutes for a product. The price elasticity coefficient of demand is directly related to the percentage of one’s budget spent for a good or service. In general, the price elasticity coefficient of demand is higher the longer a price change persists. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the demand curve slopes downward and the supply curve slopes upward, sellers cannot raise the price by the full amount of the tax. In the case where demand is perfectly inelastic, sellers can raise the price by the full amount of a tax.  </span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ggsqc11p41v" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Production Costs</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explicit costs are payments to nonowners of a firm for their resources. Implicit costs are the opportunity costs of using resources owned by a firm. Economic profit is total revenue minus explicit and implicit costs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normal profit is the minimum profit necessary to keep a firm in operation. A firm that earns normal profits earns total revenue equal to its total opportunity cost. Since business decision making is based on economic profit, rather than accounting profit, the word profit always means economic profit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixed input is any resource for which the quantity cannot change during the period of time under consideration. A variable input is any resource for which the quantity can change during the time under consideration.  A short run is a period of time so short that there is at least one fixed input. A long run is a period of time so long that all inputs are variable. The production function is the relationship between the maximum amounts of output a firm can produce and various quantities of inputs. A marginal product is the change in total output produced by adding one unit of a variable input, with all other inputs used being held constant. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The  law of diminishing returns is the principle that beyond some point the marginal product decreases as additional units of a variable factor are added to a fixed factor. The total fixed cost is a cost that does not vary as output varies and that must be paid even if output is zero. These are payments that the firm must make in the short run, regardless of the level of output. The total variable cost is the cost that is zero when output is zero and varies as output varies. The total cost is the sum of total fixed cost and total variable cost at each level of output. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average fixed cost is the total fixed cost divided by the quantity of output produced. The average variable cost is the total variable cost divided by the quantity of output produced. The average total cost is the total cost divided by the quantity divided by the quantity of output produced. The marginal cost is the change in total cost when one additional unit of output is produced. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The marginal average rule is the rule that states when marginal cost is below average cost, average cost falls. When marginal cost is above average cost, average cost rises. When marginal cost equals average cost, average cost is at its minimum point. A firm operates in the short run when there is insufficient time to alter some fixed input. The firm plans in the long run when all inputs are variable. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long run average cost curve traces the lowest cost per unit at which a firm can produce any level of output when the firm can build any desired plant size. Economies at scale is a situation in which the long run average cost curve declines as the firm increases output. The constant returns to scale is a situation in which the long run average cost curve does not change as the firm increases output. Diseconomies of scale is a situation in which the long run average cost curve rises as the firm increases output. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic profit is equal to total revenue minus both explicit and implicit costs. Explicit costs are payments to nonowners of a firm for their resources. Implicit costs are the opportunity costs of forgone returns to resources owned by a firm. Economic profit is total revenue minus explicit and implicit costs. Economic profit can be positive, zero, or negative. Economic profit is important for decision making purposes because it includes implicit costs and accounting profit does not. Accounting profit equals total revenue minus explicit costs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normal profit is the minimum profit necessary to keep a firm in operation. A normal profit is a zero economic profit, and it signifies there is just enough total revenue to pay the owners for all explicit and implicit costs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fixed input is any resource for which the quantity cannot change during the period of time under consideration. A variable input is any resource for which the quantity can change during the period of time under consideration. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short run is a time period during which a firm has at least one fixed input, such as its factory size. The long run for a firm is defined as a period during which all inputs are variable.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A production function is the relationship between output and inputs. Holding all other factors of production constant, the production function shows the total output as the amount of one input, such as labor, varies. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginal product is the change in total output caused by a one unit change in a variable input, such as the number of workers hired. The law of diminishing returns states that after some level of output in the short run, each additional unit of the variable input yields a smaller and smaller marginal product. This range of declining marginal products is the region of diminishing returns.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total fixed cost consists of costs that do not vary with the level of output, such as rent for office space. Total fixed cost is the cost of inputs that do not change as a firm changes output in the short run. Total variable cost consists of costs that vary with the level of output, such as wages. Total cost is the sum of total fixed cost and total variable cost. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginal cost is the change in total cost associated with one additional unit of output. Average fixed cost is the total fixed cost divided by total output. Average variable cost is the total variable cost divided by total output. Average total cost is the total cost divided by output, or the sum of average fixed cost and average variable cost. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The marginal-average rule explains the relationship between marginal cost and average cost. When marginal cost is less than average cost, average cost falls. When marginal cost is greater than average cost, average cost rises. Following this rule, the marginal cost curve intersects the average variable cost curve and the average total cost curve at their minimum points. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-run average cost curve is a curve drawn tangent to all possible short run average total cost curves. When it decreases as output increases, a firm experiences economies at scale. If it remains unchanged as output increases, a firm experiences constant returns to scale. If the curve increases as output increases, a firm experiences diseconomies at scale. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since business decision making is based on economic profit, rather than accounting profit, the work profit in this text always means economic profit. A firm operates in the short run when there is insufficient time to alter some fixed input. The firm plans in the long run when all inputs are variable. The plant size selected by a firm in the long run depends on the expected level of production.  </span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ggv6p9gj59u" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Perfect Competition</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market structure is a classification system for the key traits of a market, including the number of firms, the similarity of products they sell, and the ease of entry into and exit from the market. Perfect competition is a market structure characterized by a large number of small firms, a homogeneous product, and very easy entry into or exit from the market. Perfect competition is also called pure competition. The large number of sellers' conditions is met when each firm is so small relative to the total market that no single firm can influence the market price.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A homogeneous product is a good or service that is identical regardless of which firm produces it. If a product is homogeneous, buyers are indifferent as to which seller’s product they buy. A barrier to entry is any obstacle that makes it difficult for a new firm to enter a market. Perfect competition requires that resources be completely mobile to freely enter or exit a market. A price taker is a seller that has no control over the price of the product it sells. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginal revenue is the change in total revenue from the sale of one additional unit of output. In perfect competition, the firm’s marginal revenue equals the price, which the firm views as a horizontal demand curve. In perfect competition, the firm maximizes profit or minimizes loss by producing the output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The firm will shut down when the price drops below the minimum average variable cost. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfectly competitive firm’s short run supply curve is a firm’s marginal cost curve above the minimum point on its average variable cost curve. The perfectly competitive industry’s short run supply curve is the supply curve derived from horizontal summation of the marginal cost curves of all firms in the industry above the minimum point of each firm’s average variable cost curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfectly competitive industry’s long run supply curve is the curve that shows the quantities supplied by the industry at different equilibrium prices after firms complete their entry and exit. A constant cost industry is an industry in which the expansion of industry output by the entry of new firms has no effect on the individual firm’s average total cost curve. The long run supply curve in a perfectly competitive constant cost industry is perfectly elastic and drawn as a horizontal line. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market structure consists of three market characteristics; number of sellers, nature of the product, and ease of entry into the market. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfect competition is a market structure in which an individual firm cannot affect the price of the product it produces. Each firm in the industry is very small relative to the market as a whole, all the firms sell a homogenous product, and firms are free to enter and exit the industry. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A homogenous product is a good or service that is identical regardless of which firm produces it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A price taker firm in perfect competition faces a perfectly elastic demand curve. It can sell all it wishes at the market determined price, but it will sell nothing above the given market  price. This is because so many competitive firms are willing to sell the same product at the going market price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total revenue total cost method is one way a firm determines the level of output that maximizes profit. Profit reaches a maximum when the vertical difference between the total revenue and the total cost curve is a maximum. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The marginal revenue equals marginal cost method is a second approach to finding where a firm maximizes profits. Marginal revenue is the change in total revenue from a one unit change in output. Marginal revenue for a perfectly competitive firm equals the market price. The mr=mc rule states that the firm maximizes profit or minimizes loss by producing the output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. If the price is below the minimum point on the average variable cost curve, the mr=mc rule does not apply, and the firm shuts down to minimize its losses. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The perfectly competitive firm’s short-run supply curve is a curve showing the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity supplied in the short run. The individual firm always produces along its marginal cost curve above its intersection with the average variable cost curve. The perfectly competitive industry’s short-run supply curve is the horizontal summation of the short-run supply curves of all the firms in the industry. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long run perfectly competitive equilibrium occurs when a firm earns a normal profit by producing where price equals the minimum long-run average cost, the minimum short-run average, and the short-run marginal cost. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a constant-cost industry, total output can be expanded without an increase in the individual firm’s average total cost. Because input prices remain constant, the long-run supply curve in a constant-cost industry is perfectly elastic. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The large number of sellers' conditions is met when each firm is so small relative to the total market that no single firm can influence the market price. If a product is homogenous, buyers are indifferent as to which seller’s product they buy. Perfect competition requires resources to be completely mobile to freely enter or exit a market. In perfect competition, the firms’ marginal revenue equals the prices, which the firm views as a horizontal demand curve.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In perfect competition, the firm maximizes profit or minimizes losses by producing the output where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The firm will shut down when the price drops below the minimum average variable cost. The long-run supply curve is a perfectly competitive constant-cost industry that is perfectly elastic and drawn as a horizontal line.</span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1gi1blfau56" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Monopoly</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A monopoly is a market structure characterized by a single seller, unique product, and impossible entry into the market. A natural monopoly is an industry in which the long run average cost of production declines throughout the entire market. As a result, a single firm can supply the entire market demand at a lower cost than two or more smaller firms. A network good is one that increases in value to each user as the total number of users increases. As a result, a firm can achieve economies of scale. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of economies of scale, a single firm in an industry can produce enough output to satisfy market demand and produce this output at a lower per unit cost than would be possible if the market was served by more than one firm. As the number of people connected to a network goods system increases, the greater the benefits each person receives from being in the network. A price maker is a firm that faces a downward sloping demand curve and therefore it can choose among the price and output combinations along the demand curve.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand and marginal revenue curves of the monopolist are downward sloping. In contrast to the horizontal demand and corresponding marginal revenue curves facing the perfectly competitive firm. The marginal revenue curve for a straight line demand curve intersects the quantity axis halfway between the origin and the quantity axis intercept of the demand curve. The monopolist always maximizes profit by producing at a price on the elastic segment of its demand curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the positions of a monopolist’s demand and cost curves give it a profit and nothing disturbs these curves, the monopolist will earn profit in the long run. Price descrimination is the practice of a seller charging different prices for the same product that are not justified by cost differences. Arbitrage is the practice of earning a profit by buying a good at a low price and reselling the good at a higher price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A monopolist is characterized by inefficiency because resources are underallocated to the production of its product. Monopoly harms consumers on two fronts. The monopolist charges a higher price and produces a lower output that would result under a perfectly competitive market structure.   </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monopoly is a single seller that faces the entire industry demand curve because it is the only seller. The monopolist sells a unique product, and extremely high barriers to entry protect it from competition. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barriers to entry that prevent new firms from entering an industry are: ownership of an essential resource, legal barriers, and economies of scale. Government franchises, licenses, patents, and copyrights are the most obvious legal barriers to entry.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural monopoly arises because of the existence of economies of scale in which the long-run average cost curve falls over the full range of output demanded in the market. Economies of scale allow a single firm, rather than several firms, to produce enough output to satisfy the entire market demand at the lowest possible cost. Whichever firm expands first gains a cost advantage and monopoly status, as smaller firms leave the industry because of their high costs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A network good is a good that increases in value to each user as the total number of users increases. A price maker firm faces a downward sloping demand curve. It therefore searches its demand curve to find the price-output combination that maximizes its profit or minimizes its losses. The marginal revenue and demand curves are downward sloping for a monopolist. The marginal revenue curve for a monopolist lies below the demand curve, and the total revenue curve reaches its maximum where marginal revenue equals zero. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price elasticity of demand corresponds to sections of the marginal revenue curve. When MR is positive, price elasticity of demand is elastic. When MR is equal to zero, price elasticity of demand is unit elastic. When MR equal is negative, price elasticity of demand is inelastic. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short run profit maximizing monopolist, like the perfectly competitive firm, locates the profit maximizing price by producing the output where the MR and MC curves intersect. If this price is greater than the average total cost, the firm earns an economic profit. If the price is less than average total cost but greater than average variable cost, the firm loses money but remains in business. Finally, if the price is less than the average variable cost, the monopolist shuts down to minimize losses. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long run profit maximizing monopolist earns a profit because of barriers to entry. If demand is low and costs or high, thus creating the prospect of long run losses, the monopolist will leave the industry. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price descrimination allows the monopolist to increase profits by charging buyers different prices rather than a single price. Three conditions are necessary for price descrimination: the seller possesses some price setting ability, buyers in different markets must have different price elasticities of demand, and buyers must be prevented from reselling the product at a higher price than the purchase price.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monopoly disadvantages include the following: a monopolist charges a higher price and produces less output than a perfectly competitive firm. Resource allocation is inefficient because the monopolist produces less than if competition existed. Monopoly produces higher long run profits than if competition existed. Monopoly transfers income from consumers to producers to a greater degree than under perfect competition. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of economies of scale, a single firm in an industry will produce output at a lower pre-unit cost than two or more firms.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the number of people connected to a network goods system increases, the greater the benefit each person receives from the network goods. The demand and marginal revenue curves of the monopolist are downward sloping in contrast to the horizontal demand and corresponding marginal revenue curves facing the perfectly competitive firm. The marginal revenue curve for a straight line demand curve intersects the quantity axis halfway between the origin and the quantity axis intercept of the demand curve. The monopolist always maximizes profit by producing at a price on the elastic segment of its demand curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the positions of a monopolist’s demand and cost curves give it a profit and nothing disturbs these curves, the monopolist will earn profit in the long run. A monopolist is characterized by inefficiency because resources are under allocated to the production of its product. Monopoly harms consumers on two fronts. The monopolist charges a higher price and produces a lower output than would result under a perfectly competitive market structure.  </span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1guiacqoh1ju" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monopolistic competition is a market structure characterized by many small sellers, a differentiated product, and easy market entry or exit. The many-sellers condition is met when each firm is so small relative to the total market that its pricing decisions have a negligible effect on the market price. Product differentiation is the process of creating real or apparent differences between goods and services. A firm can charge higher prices if it makes its products seem unique. Nonprice competition is the situation in which a firm competes using advertising, packaging, product development, better quality, and better service, rather than low prices. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand curve for a monopolistically competitive firm is less elastic, or steeper,  than for a perfectly competitive firm and more elastic, or flatter, than for a monopolist. Oligopoly is a market structure characterized by few large sellers, either a homogenous or a differentiated product, and difficult market entry. Mutual interdependence is a condition in which an action by one firm may cause a reaction from other firms. The few-sellers condition is met when these few firms are so large relative to the total market that they can affect the market price. Buyers in an oligopoly may or may not be indifferent as to which seller’s product they buy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price leadership is a pricing strategy in which a dominant firm sets the price for an industry and the other firms follow. A cartel is a group of firms that formally agree to reduce competition by coordinating the price and output of a product. Game theory is a model of the strategic moves and countermoves of rivals. The payoff matrix demonstrates why a competitive oligopoly tends to result in both rivals using a low-price strategy that does not maximize mutual profits. As long as the benefits exceed the costs, cheating can threaten formal or informal agreements among oligopolists to maximize joint profits.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monopolistic competition is a market structure characterized by many small sellers, a differentiated product, and easy entry or exit from the market. Given these characteristics, firms in monopolistic competition have a negligible effect on the market price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product differentiation is a key characteristic of monopolistic competition. It is the process of creating real or apparent differences between products. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonprice competition includes advertising, packaging, product development, better quality, and better service. Under monopolistic competition and oligopoly, firms may compete using nonprice competition, rather than price competition. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short run equilibrium for a monopolistic competitor can yield economic losses, zero economic profits, or economic profits. In the long run, monopolistic competitors make zero economic profits.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comparing monopolistic competition with perfect competition, we find that in the long run the monopolistically competitive firm does not achieve allocative efficiency, charges a higher price, restricts output, and does not produce where average costs are at a minimum. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oligopoly is a market structure characterized by few sellers, homogeneous or differentiated products, and difficult market entry. Oligopolies are mutually interdependent because an action by one firm may cause a reaction from other firms.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nonprice competition model is a theory that might explain oligopolistic behavior. Under this theory, firms use advertising and product differentiation, rather than precise reductions, to compete. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price leadership is another theory of pricing behavior under oligopoly. When a dominant firm in an industry raises or lowers its price, other firms follow suit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cartel is a formal agreement among firms to set prices and output quotas. The goal is to maximize joint profits, but firms have an incentive to cheat, which is a constant threat to a cartel. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game theory reveals that oligopolies are mutually interdependent in their pricing policies, without collusion, oligopoly prices and mutual profits are lower, and oligopolists have a temptation to cheat on any collusive agreement.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comparing oligopoly with perfect competition, we find that the oligopolist allocates resources inefficiently, charges a higher price, and restricts output so that price may exceed average cost enabling long run profits.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The many sellers’ condition is met when each firm is so small relative to the total market that its pricing decisions have a negligible effect on the market price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A firm can charge higher prices if it makes its products seem unique.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand curve for a monopolistically competitive firm is less elastic than for a perfectly competitive firm and more elastic than for a monopolist.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The few-sellers condition is met when these few firms are so large relative to the total market that they can affect the market price.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buyers in an oligopoly may or may not be indifferent as to which seller’s product they buy.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The payoff matrix demonstrates why a competitive oligopoly tends to result in both rivals using a low price strategy that does not maximize mutual profits.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as the benefits exceed the costs, cheating can threaten formal or informal agreements among oligopolists to maximize joint profits.</span></p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1gftjp5f8p7" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>GDP</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gross domestic product is the market value of all final goods and services produced in a nation during a period of time.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the most reported measurement of an economy. GDP includes only current transactions, meaning final sales. It does not count purely private or public financial transactions. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A transfer payment is a government payment to individuals not in exchange for goods or services currently produced.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GDP only counts final goods that are sold or produced. Final goods are finished goods or services produced for the ultimate user. Intermediate goods are goods and services used as inputs for the production of final goods.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The circular flow model shows the exchange of money, products, and resources between households and businesses. The upper half represents product markets, in which households exchange money for goods and services produced by firms. The bottom half of the diagram represents the factor markets, in which firms demand the natural resources, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship needed to produce the goods and services sold in the product markets. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expenditure approach is the national income accounting method that measures GDP by adding all the spending for final goods during a period of time. This includes</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">C - personal consumption</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I  - investment</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">G- government spending</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(X-M) - net exports</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Formula for GDP = C+ I + G + (X-M)</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because GDP only counts market transactions, it excludes activities that are unpaid like child rearing. GDP is blind to whether a small fraction of the population consumes most of a country’s GDP or consumption is evenly divided. GDP is a quantitative, rather than a qualitative measure of the output of goods and services. GDP does not directly measure quality of life variables such as leisure time. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be argued that GDP understates national well being because no allowance is made for variables such as leisure time, life expectancy, and other such things.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Underground activities are not counted for GDP because there are no transaction records. If the underground economy is sizable, GDP will understate an economy’s performance by a sizable amount. Since the costs of negative by-products are not deducted, GDP overstates the national well-being.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, GDP has been expressed as nominal GDP. Nominal GDP is the value of all final goods based on the prices existing during the time period of production. This adjusted GDP allows meaningful comparison over time when prices are changing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measuring the difference between changes in output and changes in the price level involves making an important distinction between nominal GDP and real GDP. Real GDP is the value of all final goods produced during a given time period based on the prices existing in selected base year. GDP chain price index is a measure that compares changes in the prices of all final goods during a given year relative to the prices of those goods in a base year. This index is also called GDP price index or simply GDP deflator. </span></p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1gftjp5f8p8" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Business and Unemployment</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The business cycle is alternating periods of economic growth and contraction. These changes are measured in real GDP. The peak is the phase of the business cycle in which real GDP reaches its maximum after rising during a recovery. A recession is the downturn in the business cycle during which GDP declines and the unemployment rate rises. It is also called a contraction.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trough is the phase of the business cycle in which real GDP reaches its minimum after falling during a recession. An expansion is an upturn in the business cycle during which real GDP rises. This is also known as a recovery. Economic growth is an expansion in national output measured by the annual percentage increase in a nation’s real GDP.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We value economic growth as one of our nation’s economic goals because it increases our standard of living. Leading indicators are variables that change before real GDP changes. Coincident indicators are variables that change at the same time that real GDP changes. Lagging indicators are variables that change after real GDP changes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unemployment rate is the percentage of people in the civilian labor force who are without jobs and are actively seeking jobs. The civilian labor force is the number of people 16 years or older who are employed or who are actively seeking a job, excluding armed forces, homemakers, discouraged workers, and other persons not in the labor force.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A discouraged worker is a person who wants to work but has given up searching for work because they believe there will be no job offers. Frictional unemployment is temporary unemployment caused by the time required of workers to move from one job to another. Structural unemployment is caused by a mismatch of skills of workers out of work and the skills required for existing job opportunities.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outsourcing is the practice of a company having its work done by another company in another country. Offshoring is the practice of work for a company being performed by the company’s employees located in another country. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyclical unemployment is caused by the lack of jobs during a recession. Full employment is the situation in which an economy operates at an unemployment rate equal to the sum of the frictional and structural unemployment rates. This is also called the natural rate of unemployment. The GDP gap is the difference between actual real GDP and potential for full employment real GDP. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gap between actual and potential real GDP measures the monetary losses of real goods and services to the nation from operating at less than full employment. </span></p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1gftjp5f8p9" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Inflation</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation is an increase in the general price level of goods and services in the economy. Deflation is the decrease in the general price level of goods and services in the economy. Inflation is an increase in the overall average level of prices and not an increase in the price of any specific product. The consumer price index measures changes in the average prices of consumer goods and services. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The base year is a year chosen as a reference point for comparison with some earlier or later year. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disinflation is a reduction in the rate of inflation. Nominal income is the actual number of dollars received over a period of time. Real income is the actual number of dollars received adjusted for changes in CPI. People whose nominal income rise faster than the rate of inflation gain purchasing power while people whose nominal incomes do not keep pace with inflation lose purchasing power. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wealth is the value of stock or assets owned at some point in time. Nominal interest rate is the actual interest rate without adjustment for the inflation rate. The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. An adjustable rate mortgage is a home loan that adjusts the nominal interest rate to changes in an index rate, such as rates on treasury securities. When the real rate of interest is negative, lenders and savers lose because interest earned does not keep up with the inflation rate. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyperinflation is an extremely rapid rise in the general price level. Wage price spiral is a situation that occurs when increases in nominal wage rates are passed on in higher prices which result in even higher nominal wage rates and prices. Demand-pull inflation is a rise in the general price level resulting from an excess of total spending. Cost-push inflation is an increase in the general price level resulting from an increase in the cost of production. </span></p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1gftjp5f8pa" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Fiscal Policy</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiscal policy is the use of government spending and taxes to influence the nation’s output, employment, and price level. Discretionary fiscal policy is the deliberate use of changes in government spending or taxes to alter aggregate demand and stabilize the economy.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spending multiplier is the change in aggregate demand resulting from initial change in any component of aggregate expenditures, including consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. In the intermediate segment of the aggregate supply curve, the equilibrium real GDP changes by less than the change in government spending times the spending multiplier. Marginal propensity to consume is the change in consumption spending divided by a given change in income. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any initial change in spending by the government, households, firms, or foreigners on our exports creates a chain reaction of further spending which causes a greater cumulative change in aggregate demand. The marginal propensity to save is the change in saving divided by a change in income. A tax cut has a smaller multiplier effect on aggregate demand than an equal increase in government spending. The tax multiplier is the change in aggregate demand resulting from an initial change in taxes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatic stabilizers are federal expenditures and tax revenues that automatically change levels in order to stabilize an economic expansion or contraction, sometimes referred to as nondiscretionary fiscal policy. Budget surplus is a budget in which government revenues exceed government expenditures in a given time period. A budget deficit is a budget in which government expenditures exceed government revenues in a given time period. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatic stabilizers assist in offsetting a recession when real GDP falls and in offsetting inflation when real GDP expands. Supply-side fiscal policy emphasizes government policies that increase aggregate supply in order to achieve long-run growth in real output, full employment, and a lower price level. A laffer curve is a graph depicting the relationship between tax rates and total tax revenues. </span></p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1gftjp5f8pb" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Money and the Federal Reserve System</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bartering is the direct exchange of one good or service for another good or service, rather than for money. The use of money simplifies and therefore increases market transactions. Money also prevents wasting time that can be devoted to production, thereby promoting economic growth by increasing a nation’s production possibilities. Money is anything that serves as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. Medium of exchange is the primary function of money to be widely accepted in exchange for goods and services.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A unit of account is when the function of money provides a common measurement on the relative value of goods and services. A store of value is the ability of money to hold value over time. Money is a useful mechanism for transforming income in the present into future purchases. Money is the most liquid form of wealth because it can be spent directly in the marketplace. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supply of money must be great enough to meet ordinary transaction needs, but not be so plentiful that it becomes worthless. Commodity money is anything that serves as money while having market value based on the material from which it is made. Fiat money is money accepted by law and not because of its redeemability or tangible value. An item’s ability to serve as money does not depend on its own market value or the backing of precious metal. M1 is the narrowest definition of the money supply. It includes currency and checkable deposits. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currency is money including coins and paper money. Checkable deposits are the total money in financial institutions that can be withdrawn by writing a check. M2 is the definition of the money supply that equals M1 plus near monies such as savings deposits and small time deposits of less than $100,000. M1 money is more liquid than M2 money.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal reserve system is the 12 federal reserve district banks and other financial institutions within each of the federal reserve districts. The board of governors are the seven members appointed by the president and confirmed by the US senate who serve for one nonrenewable 14 year term. Their responsibility is to supervise and control the money supply and the banking system of the United States. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Open Market Committee directs the buying and selling of US government securities which are major instruments for controlling the money supply. The FOMC consists of the seven members of the Board of governors, the president of the New York federal reserve bank, and the presidents of four other Federal reserve district banks. The federal deposit insurance corporation is a government agency established in 1933 to insure customer deposits to a limit if a bank fails. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is an independent Bureau within the federal reserve that helps consumers make financial decisions.

An economic agent is a person or group that makes choices. Individuals make choices every day. Groups can also make choices.</p><p>The choices that people make are about the allocation of scarce resources. Scarcity exists because people have unlimited desires and the world can not accommodate these desires. So, economics is the study of how everyone allocates their scarce resources.</p><p>We study economics to see what people do and what we should do. The study of what people do is called positive economics. The study of what they should do is normative economics.</p><p>Economics can be further divided into macroeconomics and microeconomics. Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole. The includes subjects like growth rate and inflation rate. Microeconomics is the study of how individuals or small entities make choices. We need to understand this when we want to understand a small piece of the economy.</p><p>The main principles of economics include optimization, equilibrium, and empiricism.</p><p>Optimization is about picking the best available option. Optimizing choices involves trade-offs. to gain one thing, you have to give up another. A budget constraint is therefore the set of things that a person can choose to do without breaking their goals. These choices also involve opportunity costs. This is something that you must give up when you make a choice. To do this, we perform a cost-benefit analysis. This is when we want to compare a set of feasible alternatives and pick the best one. We do this so that we can pick the alternative that has the largest net benefit.</p><p>Equilibrium is when everyone believes that making a change in their behavior is pointless. Everyone is trying to optimize.</p><p>Empiricism is about making choices based on data. We use data to test if theories are correct. People do this to see what is causing things in the world to happen.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The definition of economics states that it is the study of how agents choose to allocate scarce resources and the impact of those resources on society.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement that the United States has too many illegal immigrants is a normative statement since it describes what people ought to do.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement that the United States saw the unemployment rate peak at 10% in 2009 is a positive statement since it describes what people actually do.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ethical implications of a hotly debated governmental policy would best be considered a normative question, since it deals with a subjective issue based on personal preferences.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economics is divided into two broad fields of study: microeconomics and macroeconomics.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microeconomics studies a small piece of the overall economy, while macroeconomics studies the economy as a whole.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policy decisions made by the government are analyzed by both microeconomics and macroeconomics.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A policy such as those limiting a firm’s monopoly powers would be studied under microeconomics, since it deals with a small part of the overall economy. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three principles of economics include optimization, equilibrium, and empiricism.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empiricism describes a situation where economists use data to analyze what is happening in the world.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimization describes a situation where people weigh costs and benefits when making a decision.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equilibrium describes a situation where no one would benefit from changing his or her behavior.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economics, anthropology, psychology, sociology and political science all study human behavior.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists differ from these other social sciences because it also addresses the three key concepts of optimization, equilibrium, and empiricism.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose your new year resolution is to get back into shape. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How would you evaluate your options and choose an optimal one?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do a cost-benefit analysis to compare the alternatives.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When making your decisions about which activity to choose, you should consider the monetary cost as well as the opportunity costs of the activities.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to choose the option that offers the greatest net benefit.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the process of optimization, economists believe that people are considering the feasibility of a choice, given the available information at the time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of optimization for an individual is to maximize overall well being.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose that you allocate $20 each week for your entertainment budget. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This money is spent on two items: either renting movies for $1 each or downloading songs at $1 each.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given this information: which of the following would represent your budget constraint for entertainment?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amount spent on songs plus the amount spent on movies equals $20.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your budget constraint for entertainment illustrates the concepts of tradeoffs, since as you increase your purchases of one item, you must decrease your purchases of the other item.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opportunity cost of an item is a measure of what is given up when you do that activity.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s say you are trying to decide on what to do on Friday at 11 am. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You rank your possible options from the one you value the most to the one that you value the least in the following order: going to class, sleeping in late, going to work early, getting lunch, going to the gym, and watching tv.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you decide to go to class, then what do we know about the opportunity cost of your decision?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opportunity cost would be sleeping in late, since it is your next best option.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comparing a set of feasible alternatives and picking the best one is an optimization process called cost-benefit analysis.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free riding occurs when people’s private benefits are out of sync with the public interest.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which of the following is subject to the free rider problem?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All: neighborhood watch, national security, and public libraries.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which of the following is more susceptible to the free rider problem? Funded symphonies or public roads.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use of public roads is more susceptible since even those who don’t pay taxes still benefit, while government funded symphonies can charge for admission, so that everyone who goes pays their share.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a market to be in equilibrium, three conditions must hold.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount produced by sellers must be equal to the amount purchased by buyers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The costs of making a product must be less than the final price at which the product sells.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buyers must place a value on the uses of a product that is greater than the cost of buying the product.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which of the following is true regarding the concept of causation?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It describes how one event can bring about change in another.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which of the following is not an example of a causal claim?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It rains more often on days you wash your car.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify the cause and effect in the following examples.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower infant mortality is an effect and an improvement in nutrition is the cause.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A surge in cocoa prices is an effect and a pest attack on cocoa crops is the cause.</span></p><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1gum5q0ol1nt" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Using Data and Models</strong></span></h2><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">The scientific method is the name for the ongoing process that economists and other scientists use to develop models of the world. Empirical evidence is facts that are obtained through observations and measurement. This is also called data. Economists try to uncover causal relationships among variables. An experiment can be designed to measure a causal relationship. Economists now actively pursue experiments both in the laboratory and in the field. Economists also determine causality by studying historical data that have been generated by a natural experiment.</p><p>A model is a simplified description of reality. Sometimes economists will refer to a model as a theory. These terms are usually used interchangeably. Empirical evidence consists of facts that are obtained through observation and measurement. It is also called data.</p><p>The median value is calculated by ordering the numbers from least to greatest and then finding the value halfway through the list. The mean is the sum of all the different values divided by the number of different values. Causation occurs when one thing directly affects another. A variable is a changing factor.</p><p>Correlation means that two variables tend to change at the same time. Positive correlation implies that two variables tend to move in the same direction. Negative correlation implies that two variables tend to move in opposite directions. When two variables have movements that are not related, we say that the variables have zero correlation. An omitted variable is something that has been left out of a study that would explain why two variables that are in the study are correlated. Reverse causality occurs when we mix up the direction of cause and effect.</p><p>An experiment is a controlled method for investigating causal relationships among variables. Randomization is the assignment of subjects by chance, rather than by choice, to a control group. A natural experiment is an empirical study in which some process has assigned subjects to control and treatment groups in a random or nearly random way.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To say that economists use the scientific method means that they are using an ongoing process to develop models of the world and then test and evaluate those models.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do economists distinguish between models that work and those that don’t?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They test their models against real-world data.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does the sample size affect the validity of an empirical argument?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The larger the sample size the better.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you thought income inequality in the US had increased over time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you expect the ratio of the mean income in the US to the median income to have risen or fallen?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risen, because means change more with extreme values.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you have been hired as a management consultant by a major oil company to help it optimally price gasoline at its service stations. During a meeting with your client, the CEO asks if your economic models include all factors that impact gasoline prices. What is your response?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, the model is a simplified representation of reality.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your client becomes critical of your sloppy technique of using a model that does not include all factors. How do you reply?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic models are meant to be approximations that predict what happens in most circumstances.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is still unconvinced about the reliability of using economic models to make business decisions.

However, people don’t always make the optimal choice. A large body of economic research attempts to answer the question: when do people succeed in choosing the best feasible option and when do they fail. Using the concept of optimization to describe and predict behavior is an example of positive economic analysis.</p><p>Optimization concepts also provide an excellent toolbox for improving decision making that is not already optimal. Optimization using total value has 3 steps: translate all costs and benefits into common units, calculate the total net benefit of each alternative, and pick the alternative with the highest net benefit.</p><p>Marginal analysis evaluates the change in net benefits when you switch from one alternative to another. Marginal analysis calculates the consequences of doing one more step of something. Marginal cost is the extra cost generated by moving from one alternative to the next alternative. Optimization using marginal analysis has 3 steps: translate all costs and benefits into common units, calculate the marginal consequences of moving between alternatives, and apply the principle of optimization at the margin by choosing the best alternative with the property that moving to it makes you better off and moving away from it makes you worse off.</p><p>Optimization using total value and optimization using marginal analysis yield the same answer.</p><p>Economists refer to the best feasible option as the optimal choice. Behavioral economics jointly analyzes the economic and psychological factors that explain human behavior.</p><p>Marginal analysis is a cost benefit calculation that studies the difference between one feasible alternative and the next feasible alternative. Marginal cost is the extra cost generated by moving from one feasible alternative to the next feasible alternative.</p><p>The principle of optimization at the margin states that an optimal feasible alternative has the property that moving to it makes you better off and moving away from it makes you worse off.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimization is the process that describes the choices that governments make.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimization in levels examines total net benefits, while optimization in differences analyzes the change in net benefits.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have been invited to play a 4-hour round of golf that has a value to you of $90. The total price to play the round of golf is $25.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The net benefit of the round of golf is $65.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now assume that you have a job that pays you $6 per hour.

If all sellers and all buyers face the same price, it is referred to as the market price. In a perfectly competitive market, sellers all sell an identical good and no one buyer can influence the market. A price-taker is a buyer or seller who accepts the market price. Quantity demanded is the amount of a good that buyers are willing to purchase at a given price. A demand schedule is a table that reports the quantity demanded at different prices, holding all else equal. Holding all else equal implies that everything else in the economy is held constant. The Latin phrase “ceteris paribus” is often used to say this.</p><p>The demand curve plots the quantity demanded at different prices. A demand curve plots the demand schedule. Two variables are negatively related if the variables move in opposite directions. The law of demand is when the quantity demanded rises when price falls. Willingness to pay is the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay for an extra unit of a good. Diminished marginal benefit: as you consume more of a good, your willingness to pay for an additional unit declines. The process of adding up individual behaviors is referred to as aggregation.</p><p>The market demand curve is the sum of the individual demand curves of all potential buyers. It plots the relationship between the total quantity demanded and the market price, holding all else equal. The demand curve shifts only when the quantity demanded changes at a given price. If a good’s own price changes and its demand curve hasn’t shifted, the own price changes produces a movement along the demand curve.</p><p>For a normal good, an increase in income shifts the demand curve to the right, causing buyers to purchase more of a good. For a normal good, a decrease in income shifts the demand curve to the left, causing all buyers to purchase less of the good. For an inferior good, an increase in income shifts the demand curve to the right, causing buyers to purchase more of the good. For an inferior good, a decrease in income shifts the demand curve to the left, causing buyers to purchase less of the good. Two goods are substitutes when a rise in the price of one leads to a rightward shift in the demand curve for the other. Two goods are complements when a fall in the price of one leads to a rightward shift in the demand curve for the other.</p><p>The quantity supplied is the amount of a good or service that sellers are willing to sell at a given price. A supply schedule is a table that reports the quantity supplied at different prices, holding all else equal. The supply curve plots the quantity supplied at different prices. A supply curve plots the supply schedule. Two variables are positively related if the variables move in the same direction. The law of supply, in almost all cases, is when the quantity supplied rises when the price rises.</p><p>The willingness to accept is the lowest price that a seller is willing to get paid to sell an extra unit of a good. At a particular quantity supplied, willingness to accept is the height of the supply curve. Willingness to accept is the same as the marginal cost of production. The market supply curve is the sum of the individual supply curves of all the potential sellers. It plots the relationship between the total quantity supplied and the market price.</p><p>An input is a good or service used to produce another good or service. The supply curve shifts only when the quantity supplied changes at a given price. If a good’s own price changes and it’s supply curve hasn’t shifted, the own price change produces a movement along the supply curve. The competitive equilibrium is the crossing point of the supply curve and the demand curve. The competitive equilibrium price equates quantity supplied and quantity demanded. The competitive equilibrium quantity is the quantity that corresponds to the competitive equilibrium price.</p><p>When the market price is above the competitive equilibrium price, quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded, creating excess supply. When the market price is below the competitive equilibrium price, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, creating excess demand.</p><p>A market is a group of economic agents who are trading a good or service plus the rules and arrangements for trading. In a perfectly competitive market, sellers all sell an individual good or service and individual buyers or sellers aren’t powerful enough on their own to affect the market price of that good or service.</p><p>Quantity demanded is the amount of a good that buyers are willing to purchase at a given price. A demand schedule is a table that reports the quantity demanded at different prices, holding all else equal. A demand curve plots the demand schedule. The law of demand states that in almost all cases, the quantity demanded rises when the price falls.</p><p>The market demand curve is the sum of the individual demand curves of all potential buyers. The quantity demanded is summed at each price. It plots the relationship between the total quantity demanded and the market price.</p><p>The demand curve shifts only when the quantity demanded changes at a given price. If a good’s own price changes and its demand curve hasn’t shifted, the own price change produces a movement along the demand curve.</p><p>Quantity supplied is the amount of a good or service that sellers are willing to sell at a given price. A supply schedule is a table that reports the quantity supplied at different prices. A supply curve plots the supply schedule. The law of supply states that in almost all cases, the quantity supplied rises when the price rises.</p><p>The market supply curve is the sum of the individual supply curves of all potential sellers. The quantity supplied is summed at each price. It plots the relationship between the total quantity supplied and the market price.</p><p>The supply curve shifts only when the quantity supplied changes at a given price. If a good’s own price changes and its supply curve hasn’t shifted, the own price change produces a movement along the supply curve.</p><p>The competitive equilibrium is the crossing point of the supply curve and the demand curve. The competitive equilibrium price equates quantity supplied and quantity demanded. The competitive equilibrium quantity is the quantity that corresponds to the competitive equilibrium price. When prices are not free to fluctuate, markets fail to equate quantity demanded and quantity supplied.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a perfectly competitive market, sellers cannot charge more than the market price and cannot pay less than the market price.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a perfectly competitive market, if one seller chooses to charge a price for its good that is slightly higher than the market price, then it will lose all or almost all of its customers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market demand is derived by fixing the price and adding up the quantities that each buyer demands.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does the shape of the market demand curve differ from the shape of an individual demand curve?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, they both tend to be downward sloping curves.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Law of Demand states that as the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded decreases.

This can be shown in an upward sloping supply curve or numerically in a table using a supply schedule.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationship that exists between these two variables can be described as positively related.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a firm produces more of a good, the cost of producing each additional unit increases. This implies that the marginal cost of producing a good increases as you make more of that good.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supply curve represents the minimum price sellers are willing to accept to sell an extra unit of a good.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which of the following is not one of the four major factors that shifts the supply curve when it changes?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The income of consumers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When one of the four major factors changes, causing an increase in supply, the supply curve shifts rightward.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If firms expect future price increases, how would the supply of smartphones be impacted?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There would be a leftward shift.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lobsters are plentiful and easy to catch in August but scarce and difficult in November. In addition, vacationers shift the demand for lobsters further to the right in August than in any other month. Given this information, we know that both supply and demand are higher in August than in other months.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the supply and demand curves on the right, when the price of a good is $20, we say that the market is in competitive equilibrium. At this price, we know that the quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the only change in the market was that the price increased to $30, then we know that the quantity supplied will be greater than the quantity demanded, resulting in an excess supply, which is also known as a surplus.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose instead that the price of the good dropped below the competitive price to a price of $15 per unit. If this were to occur, then the quantity supplied would be less than the quantity demanded, resulting in an excess demand, which is also known as a shortage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose a new off campus university apartment complex could rent its rooms on the open market for $900 a month. If instead the university chooses to cap the price of rooms to $500 a month for students, the result would be that quantity demanded would exceed the quantity supplied, resulting in a shortage.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose the university is trying to determine the most efficient way to allocate the rooms such that those who value the rooms the most get them. Which of the following would you suggest as the most efficient?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Auctioning the rooms to the highest bidders.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five major factors that shift the demand curve when they change are: tastes and preferences, income and wealth, availability and prices of related goods, number and scale of buyers, and buyers beliefs about the future.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law of supply states that, in most cases, the quantity supplied of a good rises when the price of a good rises. This means we would expect a typical supply curve to be upward sloping.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a perfectly competitive market, sellers cannot charge more than the market price and buyers cannot pay less than the market price.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a perfectly competitive market, if one seller chooses to charge a price for its good that is slightly higher than the market price, then it will lose all or almost all of its customers.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on what happened at the Richmond event, it is apparent that at a price of $50, the quantity demanded of laptops exceeded the quantity supplied.

It is calculated by dividing a nation’s aggregate income by the number of people in the country.</p><p>A recession is a period in which aggregate economic output fails. A worker is officially unemployed if he or she does not have a job, has actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks, and is currently available for work. The unemployment rate is the factor of the labor force that is unemployed. National income accounts measure the level of aggregate economic activity in a country. The national income and product accounts is the system of national income accounts that is used by the US government. Gross domestic product is the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a country during a given period of time.</p><p>Two variables are related by an identity when the two variables are defined in a way that makes them mathematically identical. Factors of production are the inputs to the production process.</p><p>Each firm’s value added is the firm’s sales revenue, minus its purchases of intermediate products from other firms.</p><p>Consumption is the market value of consumption goods and consumption services that are bought by domestic households. Investment is the market value of new physical capital that is bought by domestic households and domestic firms. Government expenditure is the market value of government purchases of goods and services. Exports are the market value of all domestically produces goods and services that are purchases by households, firms, and governments in foreign countries. Imports are the market value of all foreign-produced goods and services that are sold to domestic households, domestic firms, and the domestic government. The national income accounting identity, \(Y = C + I G + X - M\), decomposes GDP into consumption + investment + government expenditure + exports - imports.</p><p>Labor income is any form of payment that compensates people for their work. Capital income is any form of payment that derives from owning physical or financial capital.</p><p>Gross national product is the market value of production generated by the factors of production-both capital and labor- possessed or owned by the residents of a particular nation.</p><p>Nominal GDP is the total value of production, using current market prices to determine the value of each unit that is produced. Real GDP is the total value of production using market prices from a specific base year to determine the value of each unit that is produced.</p><p>Real GDP growth is the growth rate of real GDP. The GDP deflator is 100 times the rate of nominal GDP to real GDP in the same year. It is a measure of how prices of goods and services produced in a country have risen since the base year.</p><p>The consumer price index is 100 times the ratio of the cost of buying a basket of consumer goods using target year prices divided by the cost of buying the same basket of consumer goods using base year prices.</p><p>The rate of increase in prices is the inflation rate. It is calculated as the year over year percentage increase in a price index.</p><p>Macroeconomics is the study of economic aggregates and the economy as a whole. An aggregate is a total. Macroeconomic studies total economic activity.</p><p>Gross domestic product is the market value of the final goods and services produced in a country during a particular period of time. GDP is defined in 3 equivalent ways: Production = Expenditure = Income. The circular flow diagram explains these identities and adds a fourth identical way of measuring economic activity: factors of production.</p><p>GDP is just a summary measure of economic activity and economic well being. GDP leaves many details out, including depreciation, home production, the underground economy, externalities, inequality, leisure, and cross-border movements of capital and labor. Nevertheless, residents of countries with relatively high levels of GDP per capita report relatively high levels of life satisfaction.</p><p>Economists distinguish nominal values from real values. Real GDP measures the market value of economic production holding prices fixed at those of a particular base year. The GDP deflator is a measure of the overall level of prices in the economy. The consumer price index is another measure of the overall level of prices. Both the GDP deflator and the CPI can be used to measure the overall rate at which prices are rising: the inflation rate.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which of the following news stories would typically be studied in macroeconomics?</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe inflation should rule monetary policy.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if economic growth is no longer possible?</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expectations high for March employment.</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Production based accounting estimates GDP by computing for each firm the difference between sales revenue and the purchase of intermediate products and then sums this difference across all firms.

Purchasing power parity constructs the cost of a representative basket of commodities in each country and uses these relative costs for comparing income across countries.</p><p>GDP per worker is defined as GDP by the number of people in employment. Productivity refers to the value of goods and services that a worker generates for each hour of work.</p><p>The one dollar a day per person poverty line is a measure of absolute poverty used by economists and other social scientists to compare the extent of poverty across countries.</p><p>Human capital is each person’s stock of skills to produce output or economic value. Physical capital is the stock of all machines and buildings used for production. The physical capital stock of an economy is the value of equipment, structures, and other non-labor inputs used in production. Technology refers to a set of devices and practices that determine how efficiently an economy uses its labor and capital. An aggregate production function describes the relationship between the aggregate GDP of a nation and its factors of production.</p><p>Total efficiency units of labor is the product of the total number of workers in the economy and the average human capital of workers. The law of diminishing marginal product states that the marginal contribution of a factor of production to GDP diminishes when we increase the quantity used of that factor of production.</p><p>Research and development refers to the activities directed at improving scientific knowledge, generating new innovations, or implementing existing knowledge in production to improve the technology of a firm or an economy.</p><p>Efficiency of production refers to the ability of an economy to produce the maximal amount of output from a given amount of factors of production and knowledge.</p><p>GDP per capita, defined as aggregate income divided by total population, varies greatly across countries, with some nations have more than 40 times the GDP per capita of other nations.</p><p>GDP per capita across countries can be compared using exchange rate based measures, which rely on current exchange rates, or purchasing power parity based measures, which compare estimates of the cost of the representative basket of commodities in each country. The latter tend to be more reliable, as they more appropriately capture differences in relative prices across countries and are not subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in exchange rates. Though GDP per capita omits a wealth of other important information on health, schooling, inequality, and poverty, it provides a good summary of prosperity, and higher GDP per capita is typically correlated with higher life expectancy, better schooling, and lower poverty.</p><p>The aggregate production function links the GDP of a nation to its total efficiency units of labor, physical capital stock, technology, and efficiency of production. Greater efficiency units of labor and physical capital, as well as better technology and efficiency of production, increase GDP.</p><p>Though the total efficiency units of labor and physical capital stock matter a great deal for GDP, the most determinant of cross-country differences in GDP per worker appears to be differences in technology and the efficiency of production.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose you are comparing the income per capita in the US and Ghana.

Sustained economic growth relies on technological progress. There are sizable differences in the historical growth rates of different economies, which are largely responsible for their differences in the levels of real GDP per capita. Economic growth is a powerful tool for poverty reduction.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic growth is the increase in GDP per capita of an economy. The growth rate is the change in a quantity, for example, real GDP per capita, between two dates, relative to the baseline quantity. Exponential growth refers to a situation in which the growth process can be described by an approximately constant growth rate of a variable such as real GDP or real GDP per capita.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catch-up growth refers to a process whereby relatively poorer nations increase their incomes by taking advantage of knowledge and technologies already invented in other, more technologically advanced countries. Sustained growth refers to a process whereby real GDP per capita grows at a positive and relatively steady rate for long periods of time. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The saving rate designates the fraction of income that is saved. Technological change is the process of new technologies and new goods and services being invented, introduced, and used in the economy, enabling the economy to achieve a higher level of real GDP for given levels of physical capital stock and total efficiency units of labor. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subsistence level is the minimum level of income per person that is generally necessary for the individual to obtaIn enough calories, shelter, and clothing to survive. Fertility refers to the number of children per adult or per woman of childbearing age. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The malthusian cycle refers to the pre-industrial pattern in which increases in aggregate incomes lead to an expanding population, which in turn, reduces income per capita and ultimately puts downward pressure on population. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demographic transition refers to the decline in fertility and number of children per family that many societies undergo as they transform from agriculture to industry. The industrial revolution denotes the series of innovations and their implementation in the production process that began at the end of the eighteenth century in Britain. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many countries, including the United States, have experienced rapid economic growth over the past 200 years, increasing their real GDP per capita several times over. For example, the current real GDP per capita is about 25 times the U.S. real GDP per capita in 1820. In addition, U.S. growth has been relatively sustained, meaning that GDP per capita has grown relatively steady, with the exception of the great depression and the decade following it.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic growth can sometimes take place rapidly due to catch-up growth, whereby relatively poorer nations increase their real GDP per capita by taking advantage of knowledge and technologies already invented in other, more advanced countries.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic growth results from an economy increasing its physical capital, raising the human capital of its workers, and improving its technology. Because of the diminishing marginal product of physical capital and limits of how much each worker can invest in his or her human capital before joining the workforce, sustained growth is generally impossible to achieve just by building up human and physical capital. Rather, the most plausible driver of sustained growth is technological progress. Empirical evidence also suggests that technological progress accounts for the bulk of the increase in real GDP per capita in the United States. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the past 200 years have been characterized by sustained economic growth in many parts of the world, the preceding centuries did not experience steady growth. Instead, most economies during these times experienced Malthusian cycles: increases in GDP fueled population growth, which reduced the standard of living and subsequently acted as a check on further population growth by reducing fertility and survival. The world broke out of the Malthusian cycle through the industrial revolution, which started a process of rapid technological progress, underpinning the sustained growth of the past two centuries.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic growth has the capacity to significantly reduce poverty, provided that such growth is not associated with increased inequality. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Catch-up growth is the process by which relatively poorer nations increase their incomes by taking advantage of the knowledge and technologies already invented in other technologically advanced nations.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of catch up growth is South Korea, which by 1970 had become poorer relative to the US, but over the last 40 years grew faster than the US, closing the gap that had opened up previously.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sustained growth is the process where GDP per capita grows at a positive and relatively steady rate for long periods of time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of sustained growth is the US, which demonstrated sustained growth between 1820 and 2007.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growth equation is defined as:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\(Growth = \frac{Y_{t+1} - Y_t}{Y_t}\)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the equation for sustained growth above, explain why a country that has a very low per capita GDP can also have a very high growth rate.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A country with a very low per capita GDP can have a very high growth rate because mathematically, when the denominator is lower, even a small difference in the numerator will result in a large growth rate.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider a $100 increase in GDP per capita. In 2012 Niger had a GDP per capita of approximately $800, and the US had a GDP per capita of $50700. Calculate the corresponding growth rates for these two countries.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niger’s growth rate is 12.50 percent. The US growth rate is .20 percent.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, niger started out with a lower base and had a higher growth rate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The saving rate in an economy is defined as the fraction of total income that households save.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Factors that help household decide whether to consume or save their incomes are:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest rate</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expectations about taxes</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expectations of future income growth</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Household saving decisions impact investment in the economy by having a direct impact on investment, as saving is correlated with investment. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which factors explain economic growth in the US over the past few decades?</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human capital</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical capital</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which factor is the most important contributor to growth in the US?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A relatively simple method of gauging the change in living standards over time with a country is to compute real GDP per capita.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is done by dividing each value of real GDP by the associated population.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real GDP per capita in 2018 =  18437100000000 / 327667595 = 56268</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real GDP per capita in 2023 =  20246400000000 / 336047315 = 60249</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From 2018 to 2023 real GDP per capita increased at an average annual rate of 1.38%.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the rule of 70, the growth rate computed above, if maintained, would result in a doubling of real GDP per capita in 50.7 years.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gross government saving reflects the status of the budget; a deficit is negative saving by government while a surplus is positive government saving.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why was there no sustained economic growth before modern times, that is, before 1800?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The period before modern times was not stagnant, but it was not characterized by sustained growth. One of the possible explanations is the fact that the pace of technological change was much slower than in more recent times. Also, any increases in aggregate income were offset by increases in population, keeping per capita income low.</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increases in aggregate income were offset by increases in population, keeping per capita income low.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pace of technological change was much slower than in modern times.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no sustained growth in living standards prior to the industrial revolution because:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With output increasing at a decreasing rate, it is not possible to increase living standards, especially as the population continues to grow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The industrial revolution had a positive impact on living standards:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the introduction of new capital and technology that shifted the production curve upward.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that output increases at a decreasing rate, as is also the case with capital. This does not allow for an increase in living standards, especially as the population continues to grow.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before 1800, a pattern developed showing that increases in aggregate income led to an expanding population, which in turn reduced income per capita and put downward pressure on the population. The pattern is known as the Malthusian cycle.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Malthusian cycle was common prior to the Industrial Revolution.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What factors explain the dramatic increases in life expectancy that we saw in most countries in the twentieth century?</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientific breakthrough leading to the development of antibiotics and vaccines</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovations in disease control, including the use of DDT against malaria</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The establishment of simple but effective medical and public health practices</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assume a society consists of two economic groups: one group is rich and the other group is poor.

prosperity. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The geography hypothesis claims that differences in geography, climate, and ecology are ultimately responsible for the major differences in prosperity observed across the world.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The culture hypothesis claims that different values and culture beliefs fundamentally cause the differences in prosperity around the world.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institutions are the formal and informal rules governing the organization of a society, including its laws and regulations. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The institutions hypothesis claims that differences in institutions-that is, in the way societies have organized themselves and shaped the incentives of individuals and businesses-are at the root of the differences in prosperity across the world. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private property rights mean that individuals can own businesses and assets and their ownership is secure.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic institutions are those aspects of the

enforce private contracts, and allow free entry into new lines of business and occupations.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extractive economic institutions do not protect property rights, do not uphold contracts, and interfere with the workings of the markets.

Put differently, if we want to understand why some nations are poor, we have to ask why they do not sufficiently invest in physical capital or human capital and why they do not adopt the best technologies and organize their production efficiently. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fundamental causes of prosperity include factors that potentially influence the physical and human capital investment and technologies of nations and, via this channel, shape their prosperity.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three leading hypotheses about the fundamental causes of prosperity are geography, culture, and institutions. According to the geography hypothesis, geographic aspects determine whether a nation can be prosperous. According to the culture hypothesis, it is the cultural values of the country’s people that powerfully determine its potential for prosperity. According to the institution's hypothesis, it is the institutions that are central to prosperity.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inclusive economic institutions are those that provide secure property rights, establish a judiciary system that allows and facilitates private contracting and financial transactions, and maintain relatively free entry into different businesses and occupations. In contrast, extractive economic institutions create insecure property rights, a partial judicial system, and entry barriers that protect the businesses and incomes of a small segment of society at the expense of the rest.

At this wage, every worker who wants a job can find one: the quantity of labor demanded matches the quantity of labor supplied.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Job search refers to the activities that workers undertake to find appropriate jobs.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frictional unemployment refers to the unemployment that arises because workers have imperfect information about available jobs and need to engage in a time consuming process of job search.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wage rigidity refers to the condition in which the market wage is held above the competitive equilibrium level that would clear the labor market.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structural unemployment arises when the quantity of labor supplied persistently exceeds the quantity of labor demanded. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collective bargaining refers to the contract between firms and labor unions.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efficiency wages are wages above the lowest pay that workers would accept: employers use them to increase motivation and productivity. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downward wage rigidity arises when workers resist a cut in their wage and firms respond to this resistance by holding nominal wages fixed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The natural rate of unemployment is the rate of unemployment around which a healthy economy fluctuates.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long run rate of unemployment is the average historical rate of unemployment.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyclical unemployment is the deviation of the actual unemployment rate from the long run rate of unemployment.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potential workers are defined as the civilian non-institutional population ages 16 and older. Those holding a paid full time or part time job are classified as employed, while those without a paid job who have actively looked for work are unemployed. Potential workers who are employed and unemployed make up the labor force, while the rest of the potential workers are classified as out of the labor force. The unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unemployment rate fluctuates significantly over time. It is higher during and in the immediate aftermath of recessions.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employment is determined by labor demand and labor supply. The labor demand curve is downward-sloping because of the diminishing marginal product of labor and profit maximization by firms. In contrast, the labor supply curve tends to be upward-sloping because higher wages generally encourage workers to supply even more hours to the labor market.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The competitive labor market equilibrium is given by the intersection of the labor demand and labor supply curves. The competitive equilibrium wage is also called the market clearing wage.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a competitive labor market equilibrium in which all workers know the market clearing wage, there will be very little unemployment because every worker willing to work at the market clearing wage can find a job. Workers who are not willing to work at the market clearing wage will stop searching and will therefore not be counted as unemployed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frictional unemployment exists because workers need time to learn about the condition of the labrador market, and search for a job that suits them. Even in a healthy labor market, there will always be some unemployed workers in the process of changing jobs, or finding a new job after losing their previous one, or finding their first job after entry into the labor market.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structural unemployment results when the market wage is above the market clearing level, causing the quantity of labor supplied to be greater than the quantity of labor demanded. This is often referred to as wage rigidity. It can result from institutional features of the labor market like minimum wage legislation or collective bargaining. More importantly, it can result from efficiency wages or from downward wage rigidity. Efficiency wages arise when employers pay wages higher than the market clearing wage to increase worker productivity. Downward wage rigidity arises because of the unwillingness of workers to accept wage cuts, which prevents wages from immediately falling in response to a leftward shift of the labor demand curve.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important cause of unemployment fluctuations is a shifting labor demand curve. When wages are flexible, a shift to the left of the labor demand curve reduces both employment and wages but does not increase unemployment because the labor market clears. When wages are rigid, the same leftward shift creates a larger decline in employment because the wage does not decline and unemployment increases.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The natural state of unemployment is the rate of unemployment around which a healthy economy fluctuates. The long run rate of unemployment is the average historical rate of unemployment, which tends to be higher than the natural rate of unemployment due to the presence of structural unemployment. Cyclical unemployment is the difference between the current rate of unemployment and the long run rate of unemployment. Cyclical unemployment is positive in recessions and negative in economic booms. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain whether each of these individuals will be counted as a part of the labor force.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex is a full time student that volunteers on the weekends at an animal shelter.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John recently retired after working for the same company for 30 years.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that Alex is not in the labor force, and we know that John is not in the labor force.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that unemployment is lower among workers with a relatively higher level of education can be explained in part by the principle of optimization.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What other reasons might explain why unemployment is lower among workers with a relatively higher level of education?</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More educated workers have a higher opportunity cost of time</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workers with a higher level of education are in greater demand by firms</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More educated workers have more human capital</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February 2014, the US added 175000 jobs to the economy.

Credit allows firms to borrow for investment or households to borrow to purchase a home.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relevant price in the credit market is the real interest rate rather than the nominal interest rate. The real interest rate adjusts the price of borrowing or lending for the effects of inflation, thus reflecting the economic trade-off between the present or the future that borrowers and savers face.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firms, households, and governments use the credit market for borrowing.

At the equilibrium real interest rate, the quantity of credit demanded is equal to the quantity of credit supplied.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saving and borrowing in the credit market are intermediated by banks and other financial intermediaries. Banks play three key roles in the economy. They find credit worth borrowers and channel savings of depositors to them. They transform the maturity structure in the economy by collecting money from savers in the form of short term demand deposits and investing money in long term projects.

It makes a range of economic transactions possible, simultaneously serving as a medium of exchange that can be traded for goods and services, a store of value that enables us to save and transfer purchasing power into the future, and a common unit of account that expresses the price of different goods and services. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The money supply is the quantity of money that individuals can immediately use in transactions. The money supply is defined as the sum of currency in circulation and the balances of most bank accounts at private banks. This measure of the money supply is referred to as M2. This measure excludes all forms of bank reserves. Specifically, the money supply excludes bank reserves of private banks on deposit at the Federal Reserve.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quantity theory of money links the money supply to nominal GDP, which is the value of total output in the economy measured at current prices. The quantity theory of money implies that the long term inflation rate equals the long run growth rate of the money supply minus the long run growth rate of real GDP.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a fixed growth rate of real GDP, faster growth of the money supply leads to inflation and hyperinflation. Inflationary growth in the money supply generates social costs that firms incur as they make frequent price changes and price controls that create supply disruptions, shortages, and inefficient queuing. Moderate growth in the money supply generates certain benefits for society including seigniorage. Moderate inflation also enables employers to lower real wages without cutting nominal wages. Moderate inflation also makes it easier for the Federal Reserve to lower the real interest rate. Lower real wages and lower real interest rates stimulate growth of real GDP.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve bank in the US, attempt to keep inflation at a low and stable level and also try to maximize the sustainable level of employment.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve regulates banks, implements interbank payments, and attempts to influence macroeconomic fluctuations.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Reserve holds the reserve of private banks.

The recession was accompanied by both a demand shock and a financial shock.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One key factor initiated the 2020 recession: a coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic led consumers to reduce their demand for goods and services because of both their concerns about their own household finances and their effort to avoid being infected by the coronavirus. The pandemic led firms to cut back their activities, both because consumers were reducing demand for goods and services and because firms found it costly or even impossible to operate safely during the pandemic.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short run changes in the growth of GDP are referred to as economic fluctuations or business cycles.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic expansions are the periods between recessions. Accordingly, an economic expansion begins at the end of one recession and continues until the start of the next recession.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Great Depression refers to the severe contraction that started in 1929, reaching a low point for real GDP in 1933. The period of below trend real GDP did not end until the buildup to World War II in the late 1930’s. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there is no consensus on the definition, the term depression is typically used to describe a prolonged recession with an unemployment rate of 20 percent or more.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real business cycle theory is the school of thought that emphasizes the role of changes in technology in causing economic fluctuations.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Animal spirits are psychological factors that lead to changes in the mood of consumers or businesses, thereby affecting consumption, investment and GDP.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sentiments include changes in expectations about future economic activity, changes in uncertainty facing firms and households, and fluctuations in animal spirits. Changes in sentiments lead to changes in household consumption and firm investment.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multipliers are economic mechanisms that amplify the initial impact of a shock.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A self-fulfilling prophecy is a situation in which the expectations of an event induce actions that lead to that event.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aggregate demand is the economy’s overall demand for the goods and services that firms produce. Aggregate demand derives the hiring decisions of firms and consequently determines the labor demand curve.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actual wages are also called nominal wages, which distinguishes them from wages adjusted for inflation, or real wages. To calculate real wages, economists divide nominal wages by a measure of overall prices.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The phillips curve describes the empirical relationship between employment growth and inflation, showing that employment growth tends to produce more inflation, especially when an economy is near full employment.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All economies experience economic fluctuations. The growth rate of GDP fluctuates from year to year. During recessions, real GDP contracts and unemployment increases. On rare occasions, a recession turns into a depression, like the great depression. From 1929 to 1933, real GDP declined by 26 percent, and the rate of unemployment rose from 3 percent to 25 percent. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic fluctuations have three key properties. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-movement is when consumption, investment, GDP, and employment generally fall and rise together. Unemployment moves in the opposite direction. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limited predictability of turning points: Economic fluctuations are not pendulum-like with regular up and down cycles. It is difficult to predict in advance when an economy will enter a recession and when a recession will end. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Persistence: When the economy is growing, it will probably keep going the following quarter. Likewise, when the economy is contracting-when growth is negative-the economy will probably keep contracting the following quarter.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the labor demand curve shifts to the left, employment and real GDP fall. When the labor demand curve shifts to the right, employment and real GDP rise.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many factors explain fluctuations in economic activity.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology shocks: Changes’ in firms productivity translate into shifts in the demand curve for labor, causing fluctuations in employment and real GDP. The recession of 2020 was caused by the covid-19 pandemic, which is an example of a productivity shock.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keynesian factors: Changes in sentiments, including changes in expectations, uncertainty, and animal spirits, influence firm and household behavior. If a firm becomes pessimistic, its demand curve for labor shifts to the left. If a firms’ customers become pessimistic, they reduce their purchases, decreasing demand for the firm’s products and shifting the firm's labor demand curve to the left. An initial shift in the labor demand curve creates a cascading chain of events, multiplying or amplifying the impact of the initial shock. For example, when firms lay off workers in response to a shock, the laid off workers cut their own consumption, reducing the demand for the products of other firms. Financial factors create additional multiplier effects. Defaults, bankruptcies, and declines in asset prices lead banks to scale back their lending to firms and households, generating another round of adverse shifts in the labor demand curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monetary and financial factors: A fall in the price level is contractionary because firms face downward wage rigidities-that is, they are unable or unwilling to cut wages. Employment declines by more than it would have with flexible wages. In addition, monetary contractions cause the real interest rate to rise, reducing investment. Finally, financial crises reduce the credit available to firms and households. All these channels will shift the labor demand curve to the left, reducing employment and real GDP.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic booms tend to increase employment and reduce unemployment as the labor demand curve of the economy shifts to the right and the multiplier effects increase employment further. Economic expansions may generate inflation if the economy is already near the level of full employment. Economic booms also have a dark side because if they reverse, the economy can overshoot and sink into a recession.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiplier effects help us understand the recession of 2007-2009. Between the late 1990’s and 2006, the US housing market experienced a bubble. This bubble burst in 2006, and real housing prices fell by approximately 40 percent. The construction industry, which had been booming until then, began a sharp contraction.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falling housing prices-and by implication falling wealth-led households to cut their consumption. Firms, seeing the demand for their products decline, reduced their labor demand, starting a spiral of layoffs and further reductions in household consumption. The collapse in housing prices also led to mortgage defaults and foreclosures. The defaults and foreclosures generated huge losses for many banks, which either failed or sharply cut lending, further worsening the recession.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recession of 2020 was caused by the covid-19 pandemic, which reduced the productivity of economic exchange. Because of the risk of infection,households were less willing to demand goods and services, and many industries could not both profitably and safely supply goods and services.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first documented US infection occurred in January 2020. The US recession and stock market crash started in February, anticipating an initial large wave of infections and deaths from March to May. During this first wave of infections, large parts of the economy closed down, causing a leftward shift in the demand for labor and a spike in unemployment that was far sharper than any previously recorded in US history.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unemployment rate peaked at 14.8 percent in April, only two months after the recession started. Once the first wave of infections began to decline, many people returned to work, though the virus was still not under control. The US unemployment rate began to fall in May, just three months after the recession started.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic fluctuations are:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short run changes in the growth of gdp</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recessions are periods in which the economy:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contracts</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic expansions are defined as the periods:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between recessions</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An economic expansion begins:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of a recession</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the US, recessions are usually defined as:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two consecutive quarters of negative growth in real gdp</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average weekly hours worked by manufacturing workers is likely to be:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positively correlated with real gdp</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average number of initial applications for unemployment insurance is likely to be:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negatively correlated with real gdp</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount of new orders for capital goods unrelated to defense is likely to be:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positively correlated with real gdp</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount of new building permits for residential buildings is likely to be:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positively correlated with real gdp</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The S&amp;P 500 stock index is likely to be:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positively correlated with real gdp</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer sentiment is likely to be:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positively correlated with real gdp</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early theories of business cycles assumed that economic fluctuations had a pendulum like structure with systematic swings in economic growth.

Comparative advantage arises when a person or country has a lower opportunity cost of production than another person or country.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globalization and international trade improve the well-being of most people, but many other people are made worse off, especially low-skilled workers in developed countries who lose their jobs to foreign producers.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A country runs a current account deficit when it has a negative sum of net exports, net payments from abroad for factor payments, and net transfers from abroad. When this happens, there needs to be a corresponding flow of funds in the financial account that pays for the current account deficit. This implied a net increase in domestic assets held by foreigners and a net increase in foreign assets by domestic residents.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rapid process of globalization has been under way for several decades, increasing the total volume of international trade. Consequently, consumers and workers around the world can now take better advantage of the gains from international trade. Nevertheless, continued progress in globalization is not guaranteed. In fact, an anti-globalization backlash is now occurring, and some trade agreements have been abandoned or renegotiated. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globalization also makes the enormous inequities across nations more visible. We purchase goods and services produced and assembled by workers, sometimes even children, earning a small fraction of the wages of workers in developed countries. The working conditions in factories in the developing world are far worse than those of most low paid factory workers in foreign countries. Their alternative opportunities for employment are usually worse than these factory jobs in the traded goods sector.</span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1h05qmdgv231" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Open Economy Macroeconomics</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nominal exchange rate is the rate at which one country’s currency can be exchanged for the currency of another country.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a flexible exchange rate system, the nominal exchange rate is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixed or managed exchange rates are controlled by the government.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real exchange rate is the ratio of the prices of a basket of goods and services in two countries and thus influences net exports from one country to the other.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A decline in net exports reduces labor demand, lowers GDP, and causes unemployment.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nominal exchange rate is the price of one country’s currency in units of another country’s currency.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the government does not intervene in the foreign exchange market, then the country has a flexible exchange rate, which is also referred to as a floating exchange rate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the government fixes a value for the exchange rate and intervenes to maintain that value, then the country has a fixed exchange rate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the government intervenes actively to influence the exchange rate, then the country has a managed exchange rate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real exchange rate is defined as the ratio of the dollar price of a basket of goods and services in the US, divided by the dollar price of the same basket of goods and services in a foreign country.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nominal exchange rate is the number of units of foreign currency per unit of domestic currency. The real exchange rate, in contrast, gives the ratio of the dollar price of a basket of goods and services purchased in the US to the dollar price of the same basket purchased in a foreign country.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nominal exchange rate is determined by the supply and demand for a currency in the foreign exchange market. When a Chinese producer sells goods to a US firm and receives dollars, the Chinese firm converts the dollars to the Chinese currency in the foreign exchange market. This is equivalent to demanding yuan and supplying dollars in the foreign exchange market. In contrast, a Chinese firm that imports from the US would be doing the opposite in the foreign exchange market: supplying yuan and demanding dollars with which it will pay its US trading partners.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a country has a flexible exchange rate, changes in the supply and demand for a currency lead to fluctuations in the nominal exchange rate. Many countries, however, manage or fix exchange rates and therefore peg their currencies to another currency, such as the dollar. Under managed or fixed exchange rates, fluctuations in the supply and demand for the currency do not necessarily lead to corresponding fluctuations in the exchange rate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though managed or fixed exchange rate systems might appear more stable at first, when the exchange rates they generate are out of line with market forces, these systems can lead to sudden changes in the exchange rate. In the process, they create huge profit opportunities, like the one exploited by the financier George Soros in 1992, when he bet that the British pound would be allowed to depreciate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real exchange rate is a key price for the economy in part because it determines net exports. A real exchange rate greater than 1 implies that US goods and services are more expensive than foreign goods and services. Thus, a real exchange rate above 1 discourages exports and encourages imports, reducing net exports.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fall in net exports lowers GDP and shifts the labor demand curve to the left.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domestic interest rates influence the real exchange rate. A fall in domestic interest rates reduces the appeal of domestic assets to investors, lowering both nominal and the real exchange rates. The resulting rise in net exports shifts the labor demand curve to the right and increases GDP.</span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1h56mh9lmg" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Principles of Economics</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists Study the choices that people make. To understand these choices, they focus on the costs and benefits involved. Economics is the study of people’s choices. The first principle of economics is that people try to optimize. They try to choose the best available option. The second principle of economics is that economic systems tend to be in equilibrium. This is a situation in which nobody would benefit by changing their own behavior. The third principle of economics is empiricism. This is analysis that uses data. Economists use data to test theories and to determine what is causing things to happen in the world. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economics involves far more than money because it is the study of all human behavior. Choice is the unifying feature of all the things that economists study. Economists think of almost all human behavior as the outcome of choices. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An economic agent is an individual or a group that makes choices. The second important concept to understand is that economics studies the allocation of scarce resources. Scarce resources are things that people want, where the quantity that people want exceeds the quantity that is available. Scarcity exists because people have unlimited wants in a world of limited resources. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economics is the study of how agents choose to allocate scarce resources and how those choices affect society. Economists study the original choice and its multiple consequences for other people in the world. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive economics describes what people actually do. Normative economics recommends what people and society ought to do. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Descriptions of what people actually do are objective statements about the world. These statements can be confirmed or tested with data. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normative economics advises individuals and society on their choices. It is almost always dependent on subjective statements, which means that normative analysis depends at least in part on opinions. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economics is also divided into two other ways. Macroeconomics and microeconomics. Microeconomics is the study of how individuals, households, firms, and governments make choices. This leads to the study of how those choices affect prices, the allocation of resources, and the well-being of other agents. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole. They like to study economy-wide situations like growth of gdp or unemployment. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists emphasize three key concepts. They are optimization, equilibrium, and empiricism. Optimization is about picking the best feasible option. Economists believe that people’s goal of optimization explains most choices that people make. Equilibrium holds that economic systems tend to be in equilibrium. This is a situation in which no agent would benefit personally by changing their behavior. The economic system is in equilibrium when each agent cannot do any better by picking another course of action. In other words, equilibrium is a situation in which everyone is optimizing at the same time. Empiricism is evidence-based analysis. It is analysis that uses data. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All optimization problems involve trade-offs. Trade-offs arise when some benefits must be given up in order to gain others. Economists use budget constraints to describe trade-offs. A budget constraint is the set of things that a person can choose to do without breaking his budget. Budget constraints are useful economic tools, because they quantify trade-offs. When economists talk about the choices that people make, the economist always takes into account the budget constraint. It’s important to identify the feasible options and the trade-offs and a budget constraint gives us that information. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We face trade-offs whenever we allocate our time. When we do one thing, something else gets squeezed out. This is an opportunity cost. Evaluating trade-offs can be difficult because so many options are under consideration. Economists tend to focus on the best alternative activity. This best alternate activity is another definition of the opportunity cost. This is what an optimizer is giving up when he allocates his time to something. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost-benefit analysis is a calculation that identifies the best option by summing benefits and subtracting costs, with both benefits and costs denominated in a common unit of measurement. Cost-benefit analysis is used to identify the alternative that has the greatest net-benefit. To an economist, cost-benefit analysis and optimization are the same thing. When you pick the option with the greatest benefits, you are optimizing. So, cost-benefit analysis is useful for normative economic analysis. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most economic situations, you aren’t the only one trying to optimize. Other people’s behavior will influence what you decide to do. Economists think of the world as a large number of economic agents who are interacting and influencing one another’s efforts at optimization. In equilibrium, both the sellers and the buyers are optimizing. Nobody would benefit by changing their behavior. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People’s private benefits are sometimes out of sync with the public interest. This is the free-rider problem. Equilibrium analysis helps us predict the behavior of interacting economic agents and understand why free riding occurs.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists test their ideas with data. We refer to such evidence-based analysis as empirical analysis or empiricism. Economists use data to determine whether our theories about human behavior match up with actual human behavior. Economists are also interested in understanding what is causing things to happen in the world. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The definition of economics states that it is the study of how:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agents choose to allocate scarce resources and the impact of those choices on society</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement that the US saw the unemployment rate peak at 10 percent in 2009 is a:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive statement</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it describes what people:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually do</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement that the US is too aggressive in increasing money supply is a:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normative statement</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it describes what people:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ought to do</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ethical implications of a hotly debated government policy would be best considered:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normative question, since it deals with a subjective issue based on personal preferences</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economics is divided into two broad fields of study, microeconomics and macroeconomics.

400;">A model is a simplified description of reality. Economists use data to evaluate the accuracy of models and understand how the world works. Correlation does not imply causality. Experiments help economists measure cause and effect. Economic research focuses on questions that are important to society and can be answered with models and data. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empiricism uses data to analyze the world. It is at the heart of all scientific analysis. The scientific method is the name for the ongoing process that economists, other social scientists, and natural scientists use to develop models of the world and evaluate those models by testing them with data. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testing models with data help separate good models from bad models. A model is a simplified description of reality. Sometimes a model is also called a theory. Because models are simplified, they are not perfect replicas of reality. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientific models are used to make predictions that can be checked with empirical evidence. Empirical evidence is a fact that can be obtained through observation and measurement. Empirical evidence is also known as data. A model’s prediction is known as an hypothesis. A model is only an approximation and accordingly, understand that the model is not exactly correct. A model also makes predictions that can be tested with data. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man, or average, is the sum of all the different values divided by the number of values and is a commonly used technique for summarizing data. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Causation occurs when one thing directly affects another. Scientists refer to a changing factor, like temperature, as a variable. Scientists say that causation occurs when one variable causes another variable to change. Correlation means that two variables tend to change at the same time. As one variable changes, the other changes as well. When two variables are correlated, it suggests that causation may be possible and further investigation is warranted. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Correlations are divided into three categories, positive, negative, and zero correlation. Positive correlation implies that two variables tend to move in the same direction. Negative correlation implies that the two variables tend to move in opposite directions. When two variables are not related, we say they have zero correlation. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An omitted variable is something that has been left out of a study. Reverse causality is another problem that plagues our effort to distinguish correlation and causation. It occurs when we mix up the direction of cause and effect. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One method of determining cause and effect is to run an experiment. An experiment is a controlled method of investigating causal relationships among variables. To run an experiment, researchers usually create a treatment group and a control group. Randomization is the assignment of subjects by chance, rather than by choice to a group. The treatment group and the control group are treated identically except along one dimension that they are testing for. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A natural experiment is an empirical study in which some process has assigned subjects to control and treatment groups in a random or nearly random way. Natural experiments are a useful source of data in empirical economics. In many problems, they help us separate correlation from causation.    </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good economic questions address topics that are important to individual economic agents and to our society.

Optimization using total value calculates the total value of each feasible option and then picks the option with the highest total value. Optimization using marginal analysis calculates the change in total value when a person switches from one feasible option to another, and then uses these marginal comparisons to choose the option with the highest total value. Optimization using total value and optimization using marginal analysis give identical answers.</span></p><p><br><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists use optimization to predict most of the choices that people, households, businesses, and governments make. Optimization is often quite complex. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behavioral economics explains why people optimize in some situations and fail to optimize in others. When people have self-control problems, optimization is not a good description of behavior. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In normal cost-benefit analysis, the decision maker finds the alternative with the highest value of net benefit, which is benefit minus cost. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimizing using total value has three steps:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Translate all costs and benefits into common units, like dollars per month</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calculate the total net benefit of each alternative</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pick the alternative with the highest net benefit</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimization using marginal analysis is often faster to implement than optimization using total value, because optimization using marginal analysis focuses only on the ways that alternatives differ. Optimization using marginal analysis breaks an optimization problem down by thinking about how costs and benefits change as you hypothetically move from one alternative to another. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists use the word marginal to indicate a difference between alternatives, usually a difference that represents one step or more.  A cost-benefit calculation that focuses on the difference between one feasible alternative and the next feasible alternative is called marginal analysis. Marginal analysis compares the consequences of doing one step more of something. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginal analysis forces us to focus on what is changing when we compare alternatives. Since marginal analysis always picks out the same optimum as minimization of total cost, you can use whichever method is easier for the particular problem that you are analyzing. However, economists mostly use marginal analysis. Optimization at the margin is simple because you can ignore everything about two alternatives that are being compared except the particular attributes that are different. Marginal analysis reminds you to exclude information that is not relevant to your decision. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To sum up, marginal analysis has three key steps:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Translate all costs and benefits into common units, like dollars per month</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calculate the marginal consequences of moving between alternatives</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply the Principle of Optimization at the Margin by choosing the best alternative with the property that moving to it makes you better off and moving away from it makes you worse off.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginal analysis can be used to solve any optimization problem. Marginal analysis is most commonly used when there is clear sequence of feasible alternatives. </span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1h5el3mvl17" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a perfectly competitive market, sellers all sell an identical good or service. Any individual buyer or seller isn’t powerful enough on his own to affect the market price of that good or service. The demand curve plots the relationship between the market price and the quantity of a good demanded by buyers. The supply curve plots the relationship between the market price and the quantity of a good supplied by sellers. The competitive equilibrium price equates the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied. When prices are not free to fluctuate, markets fail to equate quantity demanded and quantity supplied. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A market is a group of economic agents who are trading a good or service plus the rules and arrangements for trading. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If all sellers and all buyers face the same price, that price is referred to as the market price. This implies that buyers and sellers are all price-takers. They accept the market price and can’t bargain for a better price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a given price, the amount of the good or service that buyers are willing to purchase is called the quantity demanded. A table that reports the quantity demanded at different prices is called a demand schedule. Plotting a demand schedule is called a demand curve. The demand curve has an important property which is that the price of gasoline and the quantity demanded are negatively related. They move in opposite directions. When one goes up, the other goes down. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost all goods have demand curves that exhibit this fundamental negative relationship, which economists call the law of demand. The law of demand says that the quantity demanded rises when the prices fall. Diminishing marginal benefit is when you consume more of a good, your willingness to pay for an additional unit declines.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though almost all individual demand curves are downward sloping, that is all they have in common. The demand of all buyers in a market is the market demand curve. It is the sum of the individual demand curves of all potential buyers. The market demand curve plots the relationship between the total quantity demanded and the market price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand curve shifts when these 5 major factors change:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tastes and preferences</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Income and wealth</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Availability and prices of related goods</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Number and scale of buyers</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buyer’s beliefs about the future</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A change in tastes or preferences is simply a change in what we personally like or value. This would be a leftward shift in demand because a lower quantity demanded for a given price of oil corresponds to a leftward movement on the x-axis. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand curve shifts only when the quantity demanded changes at a given price. If a good’s own price changes and its demand curve hasn’t shifted, the own price change produces a movement along the demand curve. It helps to remember that if the quantity demanded changes at a given price, then the demand curve has shifted. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A change in income or wealth affects your ability to pay for goods and services. For a normal good, an increase in income shifts the demand curve to the right, causing buyers to purchase more of the good. If rising income shifts the demand curve for a good to the left, then the good is called an inferior good. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if the price of oil hasn’t changed, a change in the availability and prices of related goods will also influence demand for oil products, thereby shifting the demand curve for oil. Two goods are said to be substitutes when a rise in the price of one leads to a rightward shift in the demand curve for the other. Two goods are said to be complements when a fall in the price of one good leads to a rightward shift in the demand curve for the other good. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the number of buyers increases, the demand curve shifts right. When the number of buyers decreases, the demand curve shifts left. The scale of the buyers’ purchasing behavior also matters. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changes in buyer’s beliefs about the future also influence the demand curve.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interaction of buyers and sellers in a marketplace determines the market price. We want to analyze the relationship between the price of a good and the amount of the good that sellers are willing to sell or supply. At a given price, the amount of that good or service that sellers are willing to supply is called the quantity supplied. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A supply schedule is a table that reports the quantity supplied at different prices. The supply schedule shows that Exxon increases the quantity of oil supplied as the price of oil increases. So, a supply curve plots the supply schedule table. The supply curve of oil shows that the price of oil and the quantity supplied are positively related. This means that the variables move in the same direction. When one variable goes up, the other goes up too. In almost all cases, quantity supplied and price are positively related, which economists call the law of supply.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For an optimizing firm, the height of the supply curve is the firm’s marginal cost. A firm;s willingness to accept is the lowest price that a seller is willing to get paid to sell an extra unit of a good. For an optimizing firm, willingness to accept is the same as the marginal cost of production. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we studied buyers, we summed up their individual demand curves to obtain a market demand curve. We do the same thing for sellers. Adding up the quantity supplied world the same way as adding up the quantity demanded. We add up quantities at a particular price. We then repeat this at every possible price to plot the market supply curve. The market supply curve plots the relationship between the total quantity supplied and the market price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aggregating the individual supply curves of thousands of oil producers yields a market supply curve. Recall that the supply curve describes the relationship between price and quantity supplied. There are four major types of variables that are held fixed when a supply curve is constructed. The supply curve shifts when these variables change:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince inputs used to produce a good </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology used to produce the good</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Number and scale of buyers</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers’ beliefs about the future</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changes in the prices of inputs shift the supply curve. An input is a good or service used to produce another good or service. The supply curve shifts only when the quantity supplied changes at a given price. If a good’s own price changes and its supply curve hasn’t shifted, the own price change produces a movement along the supply curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changes in technology also shift the supply curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changes in the number of sellers also shift the supply curve. Finally, changes in seller’s beliefs about the future shift the supply curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competitive markets converge to the price at which quantity supplied and quantity demanded are the same. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand curves slope down and supply curves slope up. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists refer to the crossing point of the two curves as the competitive equilibrium. This is also called the market clearing price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price at the crossing point is the competitive equilibrium price.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quantity at the crossing point is the competitive equilibrium quantity.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the competitive equilibrium price, the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a perfectly competitive market, sellers:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannot charge more than the market price and buyers cannot pay less than the market price</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a perfectly competitive market, if one seller chooses to charge a price for its good that is slightly higher than the market price, then it will:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lose all or almost all of its customers</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market demand is derived by:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fixing the price and adding up the quantities that each buyer demands</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does the shape of the market demand curve differ from the shape of the individual demand curve:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, they both tend to be downward sloping curves</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is an inverse relationship between the quantity demanded of books and their price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law of demand states that as the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded decreases.

An optimizing buyer makes decisions at the margin. An individual’s demand curve reflects an ability and willingness to pay for a good or service. Consumer surplus is the difference between what a buyer is willing to pay for a good and what the buyer actually pays. Elasticity measures a variable’s responsiveness to changes in another variable.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, as a buyer, you want to buy goods and services that you like, because you prefer to buy what tastes good, sounds good, or looks good. You must also consider prices of the various goods and services that interest you. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits that you receive from consuming goods and services are a direct result of your tastes and preferences. When it comes to the buyer’s problem, economists assume that the consumer attempts to maximize the benefits from consumption. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prices are the most important incentives that economists study. They allow us to formally define the relative cost of goods. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final ingredient of the buyer’s problem is what you can buy. The budget set is the set of all possible bundles of goods and services that a consumer can purchase with his income. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An optimizing buyer makes decisions at the margin. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A decrease in the price of either good will cause the budget constraint to pivot outward. When a price changes, the opportunity cost changes. This will cause the buyer to change the optimal quantities consumed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an understanding of how to spend optimally, we can begin to construct demand curves. An individual’s willingness to pay measured over different quantities of the same good makes up the individual’s demand curve. The demand curve isolates the contribution that a good’s own price makes toward determining the quantity demanded in a given time period.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quantity demanded refers to the amount of a good that buyers are willing to purchase at a particular price. A demand curve maps how quantity demanded responds to price changes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand curve shows how the quantity demanded depends on the price of the good. The demand curve is downward sloping. Every point on your demand curve represents a unique price and quantity level. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have learned we should recognize the incentives that we face and make decisions based on marginal analysis. That is, we should consider the marginal benefits and marginal costs in our decision making. In markets, the process of optimal decision making by consumers often yields total benefits well above the price we pay for goods. Economists give these market-created benefits a name, consumer-surplus. Consumer surplus is the difference between the willingness to pay and the price paid for the good. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When price increases, consumer surplus decreases. The higher the price, the smaller the difference between the willingness to pay and the market price. Furthermore, the higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we want to know how responsive quantity demanded is to a change in price, we want to know about price elasticity. Elasticity measures the sensitivity of one economic variable to a change in another. In other words, it tells us how much one variable changes when another variable changes. More precisely, elasticity is a ratio of percentage changes in variables. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elasticity is an important concept because it takes into account not only the direction of change but also the size of the change. The different types are:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price elasticity of demand</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-price elasticity of demand</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Income elasticity of demand</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know from the law of demand that when the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded generally falls. However, we do not know how much quantity demanded falls. The price elasticity of demand measures the percentage change in quantity demanded of a good resulting from a percentage change in the good’s price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distinction between whether a good has a price elasticity of demand greater than or less than 1 is very important. A price elasticity of 1 says that if the price is increased by 20% then quantity demanded decreases by 20%. 20/20=1. So, if price elasticity is greater than 1, price increases hurt revenue.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elasticity is much different than the slope of a line. Even though the slope is the same over the entire demand curve, the elasticity varies over the slope of the line. This is because the ratio of price to quantity changes as we move along the demand curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, elasticities tend to vary over ranges of the demand curve. They are different at the top, middle, and bottom of the curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another measure that economists often calculate is arc elasticity. The arc elasticity achieves a stable elasticity regardless of the starting point by using the average price and quantity in the calculation. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goods with a price elasticity of demand greater than 1 have elastic demand. The percentage change in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage change in price. Peanut butter is an example.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goods with a price elasticity of demand equal to 1 have unit elastic demand. 1 percent price change affects quantity demanded by 1 percent. So, in this example, a price increase does not affect revenue. Wine is a good with this characteristic. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goods with a price elasticity of demand less than 1 have inelastic demand. When the price elasticity of demand is less than 1, the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price. Cigarettes are such a good. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand can also be perfectly inelastic, which means that quantity demanded is completely unaffected by price. An example of this is insulin, you just have to have it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists have pinpointed three primary reasons for elasticity differences:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Closeness of substitutes</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget share spent on the good</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Available time to adjust</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists are interested in much more than merely how changes in a good’s price affect consumers. Another type of inelasticity that economists consider is how quantity demanded for one good changes when the price of a substitute or complement good changes. This is called the cross-price elasticity of demand. It is a measurement of the percentage change in quantity demanded of a good due to a percentage change in another good’s price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a cross-price elasticity is negative, then the two goods are complements. Two goods are complements when the fall in the price of one leads to a right shift in the demand curve for another. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a cross-price elasticity is positive, then the two goods are substitutes. Two goods are substitutes when the rise in the price of one leads to a right shift in the demand curve for the other. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A third type of elasticity measurement has to do with how changes in income affect consumption patterns. The income elasticity of demand informs us of the percentage change in quantity demanded of a good due to a percentage change in the consumer’s income. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good is normal if the quantity demanded is directly related to income. When income rises, consumers buy more of a normal good.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good is inferior if the quantity demanded is inversely related to income. When income rises, consumers buy less of an inferior good. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which of the following are necessary ingredients to the buyer’s problem?</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prices of goods and services</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amount of money the consumer has to spend</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers tastes and preferences</span></li></ol><p><br><br><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akio consumes two goods, books and video games.

The supply curve reflects a willingness to sell a good or service at various price levels. Producer surplus is the difference between the market price and the marginal cost curve. Sellers enter and exit markets based on profit opportunities.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three conditions characterize perfectly competitive markets are:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No buyer or seller is big enough to influence the market price</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers in the market produce identical goods</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their is free entry and exit in the market</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as a consumer can buy as much as he wants at the market price, sellers are price-takers in that they can sell as much as they want at the market price. The rationale behind this assumption is that an individual seller tends to only sell a tiny fraction of the total amount of a good produced. Because the seller’s output is small relative to that of the market, the individual choice of how much to produce isn’t going to be important for market outcomes. But the combined effect of many seller’s decisions will affect the market price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three elements of the seller’s problem are:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making the goods</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost of doing business</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rewards of doing business</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A firm is a business entity that produces and sells goods or services. Every firm faces the decision of how to combine inputs to create outputs. Production is the process by which the transformation of inputs (such as labor and machines), to outputs (such as goods and services) occurs. The relationship between the quantity of inputs used and the quantity of outputs produced is called the production function. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical capital is any good, including machines and buildings, used for production. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists refer to the short run as a period of time when only some of a firm’s inputs can be varied. Alternatively, the long run is defined as a period of time wherein a firm can change any input. This means that physical capital is a fixed factor of production or an input that cannot change in the short run. That labor is a variable factor of production or an input that can change in the short run. Marginal product is the additional amount of output obtained from adding one more unit of input, such as a worker. The marginal product increases with the addition of the first few workers. This happens because workers specialize in a particular portion of their jobs. In specialization, workers develop specific skill sets to increase total productivity. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The marginal product eventually decreases with successive additions of workers. This is the same as diminishing returns of additional workers. Adding too many workers can decrease overall production. It will depend on the environment and place. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of production is what the firm must pay for its inputs. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ \text{total cost} = \text{variable cost} + \text{fixed cost} \]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total cost is the sum of variable and fixed costs. Variable costs are those costs associated with variable factors of production. A fixed cost is a cost associated with a fixed factor of production, such as equipment. It does not change with production in the short run. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average total cost is total cost divided by total output. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average variable cost is the total variable cost divided by total output. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Average fixed cost is the total fixed cost divided by the total output.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginal cost is the change in total cost associated with producing one more unit of output. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ \text{marginal cost} = \frac{ \text{change in total cost}}{ \text{change in output}} \]</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A firm makes money from selling goods. The revenue of a firm is the amount of money it brings in from the sale of its outputs. Revenue is determined by the price of its goods sold times the number of units sold.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ \text{total revenue} = \text{price} * \text{quantity sold} \]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recall that in perfectly competitive markets, sellers can sell all they want at the market price. This means they are price-takers. The price of a unit sold comes from the intersection of the market demand curve and the market supply curve. So, the intersection of market supply and market demand gives the equilibrium price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginal revenue is the change in total revenue associated with producing one more unit of output. In a perfectly competitive market, marginal revenue is equal to the market price. Therefore, the marginal revenue curve is equivalent to the demand curve  facing sellers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The profits of a firm are the difference between total revenues and total costs.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ \text{profits} = \text{total revenues} - \text{total costs} \]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a firm can produce another unit of output at a marginal cost that is less than the market price, it should do so, because it can make a profit on producing that unit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this marginal decision making in mind, its straightforward to see how a firm maximizes its profits. It should expand production until:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ \text{marginal revenue} = \text{marginal cost} \]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the same as producing where price equals marginal cost, because marginal revenue equals price in a perfectly competitive market. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can compute total profits by taking the difference between price and average total cost at the point of production and multiplying that difference by the total quantity produced. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accounting profits are equal to revenues minus explicit costs. Explicit costs are the sorts of line item expenditures that accountants carefully tally and report, like wages or equipment costs. Economic profits are equal to total revenues minus both explicit and implicit costs.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mr=mc rule is powerful because we can determine in the short run how a competitive firm changes its output when the market price changes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When considering how responsive the firm is to price changes, we can use elasticity measures. For sellers, the most important measure that economists use is called the price elasticity of supply. This is the measure of how responsive the quantity supplied is to price changes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price elasticity of supply = percentage change in quantity supplied / percentage change in price</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price elasticity of supply will tend to be positive, because as price increases, firms tend to increase their quantity supplied.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An elastic supply means that quantity supplied is quite responsive to price changes. Any given percentage change in price leads to a larger percentage change in quantity supplied. In a perfectly elastic supply curve, a very small change in price leads to an infinite change in quantity supplied.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively. An inelastic supply means that any given percentage change in price causes a smaller percentage change in quantity supplied. In this case, at every different price, the same quantity is supplied. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like demand elasticities, the size of supply elasticities is determined by several factors. Key determinants include whether the firm has excess inventories. Likewise, how long the firm has to respond to price changes is important, the longer the time to respond, is the more elastic the supply will be. Finally, if workers are readily available, then supply will be more elastic because the firm can respond to price increases by quickly hiring workers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A shutdown is a short run decision to not produce anything during a specific time period. Sunk costs are a special type of cost that, once they have been committed, can never be recovered. One of the important things to remember about sunk costs is that once they are committed, they shouldn’t affect current or future production decisions. They can’t affect the relative costs and benefits of current and future production decisions. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short run supply curve is the portion of its marginal cost curve that lies above average variable cost. If the market price lies at a point on its marginal cost curve that lies below the minimum of the average variable cost curve, then the firm should shut down. Otherwise, it should produce. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Producer surplus is computed by taking the difference between the market price and the marginal cost curve. Graphically, producer surplus is the area above the marginal cost curve and below the equilibrium price line. In this way, it is distinct from economic profits. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A consumer’s surplus arises from being willing to pay above the market price, a producer’s surplus arises from selling units at a price that is above the marginal cost. Similar to consumer surplus, we can add up the seller’s producer surplus to obtain the total producer surplus in the market. We do this by measuring the area above the marginal cost curve that is below the equilibrium price line to compute producer surplus for the entire market. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several ways in which producer surplus can increase or decrease. For example, if a shift in the market demand curve causes a higher equilibrium market price, then producer surplus increases, because the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price line gets larger. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firms often think about more than just each day’s production. Many businesses issue quarterly reports that discuss the firm’s long term outlook. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long run is defined as a period of time in which all factors of production are variable. In the long run, there are no fixed factors of production, because even machines and buildings can be retrofitted, purchased, expanded, or sold. Because of this fact, there are important differences between a firm’s short and long run supply curves. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the short run, if it wants to change production, it can only do so by hiring or laying off workers. This is because only labor is variable in the short run. In the long run, the firm searches for the optimal combination of workers and building size. Also in the long run, the firm is able to combine workers and physical capital to achieve the minimal average total cost for each output level. This difference causes the short run cost curves to be above the long run cost curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economies of scale occur over the daily output range and such an effect might occur because as the scale of the plant gets bigger, workers have more opportunities to specialize. When average total cost does not change with the level of output, the plant experiences constant returns to scale. Diseconomies of scale occur when average total cost increases as output rises and this might happen because management teams begin to get spread too thin or duplication of tasks occurs.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An exit is a long run decision to leave the market. Exit if price is less than average total cost or if total revenue is less than total cost. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long run supply curve is the portion of its marginal cost curve that lies above the average total cost. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total profit in the long run is computed exactly like its short run profit. Total revenue minus total cost. Profit equals the difference between price and average total cost multiplies by the quantity sold. Accordingly, when computing producer surplus in the long run, we take the difference between market price and the seller’s long run marginal cost curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like the short and long run analyses for the individual firm, at the industry level there are critical distinctions between the short run and the long run. The primary difference is that even though the number of firms in the industry is fixed in the short run, in the long run, firms can enter or exit the industry in response to changes in profitability. This is because in the long run, they have the ability to change both labor and physical capital.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is free entry into the industry, which means entry is unfettered by any special legal or technical barriers, the entry process continues until the last entrant drives the market price down to the minimum average total cost. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market supply curve is the summation of individual firms’ supply curves, adding new firms causes the industry to provide higher quality at any given price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that the market price in a perfectly competitive industry is determined by the intersection of the market demand and market supply curves. A shift to the right of the market supply supply curve lowers the market price. Atr this point, the market reaches an equilibrium, because no more firms will enter. Firms will keep entering the market as long as the new price remains above the minimum average total cost. A new entry into the market will further shift the market supply to the right and lower the market price even more. They will keep doing this until it is no longer profitable to enter the market. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free exit from the market means their exit is unfettered by any special legal or technical barrier. The firms that exit first will be the ones with the highest cost. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notice that regardless of initial demand or supply shifts and accompanying price changes in the market, entry or exit causes the market to reach the minimum of the long run average total cost curve. That is, the equilibrium quantity in the market might change due to market demand and supply shifts., but the equilibrium price always returns to the minimum of the long run average total cost. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the industry’s short run supply curve is upward sloping, the industry’s long run supply curve is horizontal at the long run minimum average total cost level. Price always returns to the minimum average total cost, and because average total cost does not change, price always remains the same in the long run. This is because variations in long run industry output are absorbed by firm entry and exit, causing long run quantity to change while equilibrium price remains the same. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second long run outcome achieved with free entry and exit is that firms in a perfectly competitive market earn zero economic profits in equilibrium. Economic profits serve as an important signal as to whether firms are better off in this industry or in some other industry. If economic profits are positive, then entry occurs until economic profits fall to zero. If economic profits are negative, exit occurs until these profits rise to zero. Free entry and exit forces price to the minimum average total cost, and therefore economic profits are zero in the long run equilibrium. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, economic profits are not the same as accounting profits. As a business owner, when economic profits are zero, it simply means that you cannot earn more money if you take your talents to a different industry. You are being paid at least your opportunity cost of time. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sellers optimize by solving the seller’s problem, which dictates that decisions are made on the margin. Expand production until marginal cost equals marginal revenue.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short and long run supply curves provide an indication of seller’s willingness to sell at various price levels. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference between price and the marginal cost curve is producer surplus.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free entry and exit cause long run economic profits to equal zero in a perfectly competitive market. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an understanding of decision making rules from the seller’s problem and the forces of free entry and exit, we can not only better understand hot ro run our own business but also better predict how sellers will respond to incentives.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In a perfectly competitive market, a seller:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cannot choose to raise the price of its goods since all sellers in the market produce identical goods, so raising the price would result in losing all its customers.</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All firms in a perfectly competitive market are said to be:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price takers</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The marginal cost curve intersects the average total cost curve at its minimum point. Graphically, the marginal cost curve should start below the average total cost curve, intersect it at the average total cost’s lowest point, and then remain above the average total cost.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the average total cost curve is decreasing, we know that the marginal cost curve is below the average total cost curve, and when the average total cost curve is increasing, we know that marginal cost is above the average total cost curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the difference between accounting profit and economic profit?</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic profit subtracts both explicit and implicit costs from total revenue.

Because resources leave those industries in which price cannot cover their costs of production and enter those industries where price can cover their costs of production, the total value of production is maximized in equilibrium. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This reasoning leads to a third distinct function of equilibrium prices in a competitive market, they allocate scarce resources across industries in an optimal manner. This is because the industry equilibrium is where p=atc=mc, and this happens only at the minimum point of the average total cost curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we know so far is that when the right market conditions are in place, self-interest and social interest, as measured by special surplus, are perfectly aligned. Price incentives lead economic agents to act in this manner. Market prices act as the most important piece of information, leading high-value buyers to buy and low-cost-sellers to sell. The flow of labor and physical capital to sectors with the highest rewards cause the production to be at just the right level in a competitive market equilibrium. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A price control is a government restriction on the price a firm can charge for a good or service. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists call the decrease in social surplus that results from a market distortion a deadweight loss. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coordination problem of bringing agents together to trade is a difficult one for central planners. After you have solved the coordination problem, you need to think about how to tackle the incentive problem, or aligning the interests of the economic agents. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A market economy has features that are remarkable at providing price signals that guide resources in a way that maximizes social surplus and makes the economy efficient. Market forces tend to eliminate waste. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity is concerned with how the economic pie is allocated to the various economic agents. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a double oral auction, both bids and asks are orally stated. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bilateral negotiations are when a single buyer and a single seller confront each other with bids and asks, rather than yelling out the offers to a group. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the strong assumptions of a perfectly competitive market are in place, markets align the interests of self-interested agents and society as a whole. In this way, the market harmonizes individuals and society so that in their pursuit of individual gain, self-interested people promote the well-being of society as a whole.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remarkable tendency of individual self-interest to promote the well-being of society as a whole is orchestrated by the invisible hand.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The invisible hand efficiently allocates goods and services to buyers and sellers, leads to efficient production within an industry, and allocates resources efficiently across industries.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The invisible hand is guided by prices. Prices incentivize buyers and sellers, who in turn maximize social surplus, the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus, by simply looking out for themselves.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can measure the progress of an economy by measuring social surplus, or how big the economic pie is. But we can also measure progress by considering questions of equity, or how the economic pie is distributed among economic agents. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The diagram on the right shows the demand and supply for jeans.

The basis for trade is comparative advantage. Specialization is based on comparative advantage, not absolute, advantage. There are winners and losers in trading states and countries. The winners from trade can more than compensate the losers. Important arguments against free trade exist. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A production possibilities curve shows the relationship between the maximum production of one good for a given level of production of another good.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comparative advantage is the ability of an individual, firm, or country to produce a certain good at a lower opportunity cost than other producers.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolute advantage is the ability of an individual, firm, or country to produce more of a certain good than other competing producers, given the same amount of resources. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The terms of trade is the negotiated exchange  rate of goods for goods. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An export is any good that is produced domestically but sold abroad.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An import is any good that is produced abroad but sold domestically. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A net importer means that imports are worth more than exports over a given time period.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free trade is the ability to trade without hindrance or encouragement from the government.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A world price is the prevailing price of a good on the world market. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Globalization is the shift toward more open, integrated economies that participate in foreign trade and investment.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protectionism is the idea that free trade can be harmful and government intervention is necessary to control trade.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The North American free trade agreement is the agreement signed by Canada, Mexico, and the United States to create a trilateral trade bloc and reduce trade barriers among the three countries.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free trade always benefits both trading partners overall. However, within any trading country, some individuals may be made worse off by trade. The losses potentially arise from reduced consumer or producer surplus, lost jobs, or lower wages.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The underlying motivation for trade relies on one simple principle: we can all be better off by trading with one another, because trade allows total production to be maximized.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ \text{opportunity cost} = \frac{\text{loss}{gains}} \]</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comparative advantage revolves around the notion of figuring out what you are relatively good at doing.

Although there are potential costs to this interdependency, the gains associated with taking advantage of specialization in the production of goods and services can be considerable.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specialization and trade, which are driven by comparative advantage, not only allow us to consume beyond our individual ppc, but also lead to a wider variety of goods and services.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas comparative advantage revolves around measuring production relative to the opportunity costs that you and the other person incur, absolute advantage relates to production per unit of inputs.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a country opens up to trade, there are winners and losers. The gains from trade are larger than the losses. One key to avoiding protests about free trade, like the one in Seattle, is to develop policies that everyone can reap the gains from trade.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empirically, the data do not reveal the sweeping job losses for US workers that trade critics cite. There is certainly a displacement of workers due to trade, but many workers soon find other jobs. Likewise, the supposed negative effect of trade on wages is difficult to find in the data. Beyond lost jobs, however, those against free trade often cite national security concerns, loss of cultural identity, environmental and resource concerns, and infant industry arguments.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The figure at right shows a ppc for Joe. he can spend his time making pizza or chocolate cakes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Joe, which production points are attainable?</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A,b,d,e (anything on the ppc line or inside of it)</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Joe, which production points are efficient?</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A,b (efficient points are those on the line)</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe decides to go to baking school and learns to make chocolate cakes faster.</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Draw a line with the same number of pizzas but more cakes and line goes through c)</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the figure on the right.

If left alone, people will generally not account for how their actions affect other, whether positive or negative. They are called market failures because of the negative effects. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are important cases in which free markets fail to maximize social surplus. Three such cases are:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Externalities</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public goods</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common pool resources</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One common link among these three examples is that there is a difference between the private benefits and costs and the social benefits and costs. Government can play a role in improving market outcomes in such cases.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market demand curve shows consumers’ willingness and ability to pay for electricity, and the market supply curve reflects producers’ marginal costs of generating it. It is at the equilibrium point where these two lines intersect that the invisible hand most efficiently allocates resources, the point at which social good is maxed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downward sloping demand curve meets the upward sloping supply curve. To determine the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity of electricity.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In economic terms, the power plant imposes an externality on the public as a by-product of producing electricity. An externality occurs when an economic activity has either a spillover cost to or a spillover benefit for a bystander. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When there are negative externalities present, this market outcome is no longer efficient. This is because negative externalities impose an additional cost on society that is not explicitly recognized by the buyers and sellers in the market. To arrive at the efficient production level, we need to recognize both the firm's marginal cost and the marginal external costs of production. Together, they sum to the marginal social cost of production. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negative externalities lead to external costs of production that the private firm will not account for when making decisions. If we take the marginal external cost into account, a higher equilibrium price and a lower equilibrium quantity result.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking into account the extra costs imposed on society by the plant’s pollution, we can see that optimal quantity is less than market quantity because when a negative externality must be accounted for, a smaller quantity of electricity should be generated since it is now more costly to produce each unit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deadweight loss is a decrease in social surplus that results from a market distortion.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive externalities occur when an economic activity has a spillover benefit that is not considered when people make their decisions. As with negative externalities, they are all around us. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pecuniary externalities exist when market transactions affect other people, but only through the market price. They act only through prices. Remember that negative and positive externalities lead to wrong equilibrium quantities. They do so because they create an external cost or external benefit that is not reflected in the market price. Pecuniary externalities don’t create these effects. Precisely because their impact is completely embodied in prices, the market price correctly reflects the society's wider impact of market transactions. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When there are negative externalities present, free markets produce and consume too much. When there are positive externalities present, free markets produce and consume too little. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When individuals or companies take into account the full costs and benefits of their actions because of some public or private incentive, economists say that they are internalizing the externalities. When the external effects of their actions are internalized, the general result is that the market equilibrium moves toward higher social well-being. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The insight that negotiation leads to the socially efficient outcome regardless of who has the legal property right is called the Coase Theorem. The theorem’s implication is powerful, private bargaining will lead to an efficient allocation of resources. This means that the person who values the ownership the most will match his preferences. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governments respond to externalities in two main ways:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Command control policies in which the government directly regulates the allocation of resources.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market based policies in which the government provides incentives for private organizations to internalize the externality.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under command and control regulation, policymakers either directly restrict the level of production or mandate the use of certain technologies. However, this type of regulation action typically provides few incentives for producers to search for more cost effective ways to reduce pollution. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A market based approach internalizes externalities by harnessing the power of market forces. The most prominent market based approaches to deal with externalities are corrective taxes and subsidies. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A corrective or Pigoivian tax is designed to induce agents who produce negative externalities to reduce quantity toward the socially optimal level. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a social planner, you understand that you must internalize externalities. One solution is to tax each unit of production by the amount of the negative externality. Such a tax allows the externality to be internalized, resulting in a more efficient outcome. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same reasoning that holds for negative externalities also applies to positive externalities, the government can use corrective subsidies to internalize the externality. A corrective subsidy is designed to induce agents who produce positive externalities to increase quantity toward the socially optimal level.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, externalities potentially drive a wedge between social benefits and costs and private benefits and costs. This wedge creates a distortion and deadweight loss if the quantity levels of the free market equilibrium diverge from those of the social optimum. Corrective taxes and subsidies can cause agents to internalize their externalities. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public goods:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one can prevent others from consumption</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One person’s consumption doesn’t prevent another person’s consumption</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private goods are excludable, meaning that people can be kept from consuming them if they have not paid for them. Public goods are non-excludable, meaning that once such goods are produced, it is not possible to exclude people from using them.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private goods are rival in consumption, meaning that they cannot be consumed by more than one person at a time. Public goods are non rival in consumption, meaning that one person’s consumption does not preclude consumption by others. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To summarize, we can say that private goods are excludable and rival in consumption and public goods are non excludable and nonrival in consumption. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ordinary private goods are both highly excludable and highly rival in consumption. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goods that are highly excludable but nonrival in consumption are called club goods or artificially scarce goods. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common pool resource goods are nonexcludable but rival in consumption.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public goods are nonrival and nonexcludable in nature. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes public goods different from private goods is precisely their nonrival and nonexcludable nature. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public goods need to be valued on the marginal benefit that a single unit of the good provides to society. For this reason, market demand curves for public goods are added along the vertical axis, producing a total willingness to pay for each unit of the public good. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private provision of public goods refers to any situation in which private citizens make contributions to the production or maintenance of a public good. This usually happens through donations of time and money. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common pool resource goods are nonexcludable so anyone can consume as much as they can. However, they are rival goods. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tragedy of the commons occurs when a common resource is used too much. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three major examples of when the invisible hand fails are externalities, public goods, and common pool resources. In each case, free markets typically do not maximize social surplus.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Externalities can occur in many shapes and sizes. They can be either positive or negative and can occur in consumption or production. The solution to externalities can come is meant by the tragedy of the commons through private or public means. The key to each is internalizing the externality. In doing so, we can align private and social incentives to maximize overall well-being.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public goods, which can be provided publicly or privately, are nonrival in consumption and are nonexcludable. This means that once they are provided, no one can be excluded, and all agents can consume them at the same time.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common pool resource goods are not excludable but are rival. This leads to an important negative externality that one person imposes on all others. Once the bluegil is taken out of the stream, no one else can catch it. Therefore, solutions to common pool resource problems mirror solutions to externalities.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key link between externalities, public goods, and common pool resources is that there is a difference between the private benefit and costs and the social benefits and costs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which of the following is not an externality?</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jordan has lung cancer from smoking cigarettes</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the private market for these pesticides shown in the graph on the right.

Well-designed regulation can improve societal outcomes but poorly designed regulation stifles economic efficiency. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the US, governments tax citizens to correct market failures and externalities, raise revenues, redistribute funds, and finance operations. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through direct regulation and price controls, governments can intervene to influence market outcomes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although government intervention sometimes creates inefficiencies, it often results in improving social well being.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weighing the trade-offs between equity and efficiency is one task of an economist.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is up to each individual to decide when and where government intervention makes the most sense. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When government tax revenues fall below spending. The government runs a budget deficit. When the converse happens and tax revenues exceed spending, the government is running a budget surplus. Total government spending and tax revenues have increased over the past several decades. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The largest component of federal government revenues comes from the individual income tax, followed by social insurance tax receipts. Corporate income tax, excise taxes, and other sources of income make up a smaller percentage of federal receipts.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual income taxes represent the largest portion, around 47% in 2013.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payroll taxes represent about a third of the federal government’s receipts. A payroll tax, also known as social insurance tax, is a tax on your wages that employers are required to withhold from employees’ pay. On your paystub, these are often listed as Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or FICA taxes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corporate income tax provides 10 percent of the overall pie. Corporate income tax is generated from taxing profits earned by corporations.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All other taxes make up the remaining 9 percent. This includes excise taxes, which are taxes paid when purchasing specific goods such as alcohol, tobacco, and gasoline.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State and local governments receive a much smaller fraction of their tax revenues from individual incomes taxes than does the federal government. Instead, property taxes, income taxes, and transfers from the federal government account for the bulk of their revenues.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four main factors influence government taxation and spending decisions:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raising revenues</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redistributing funds via transfer payments</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financing operations</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Correcting market failures and externalities</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most taxation in our economy is intended to raise revenues for the funding of public goods such as national defense, public education, police protection, and infrastructure projects. The federal government spends most of its money on national defense and social security. The two biggest items of spending for state governments are education and public welfare. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second major objective of government taxation and spending is redistribution. Market outcomes can be quite inequitable, with high levels of inequality and poverty coexisting alongside huge fortunes for a few. Governments in all advanced economies use transfer payments and the tax system to limit the extent of such inequality and the economic hardships that poorer households in the society suffer.  Transfer payments refer to payments from the government to certain groups, such as the elderly or the unemployed. Social security is the largest transfer program and was introduced by Roosevelt in 1935 to provide economic security to the elderly, disabled, widows, and fatherless children. Medicare, introduced by Lynbdon Johnson in 1965, provides health insurance to Americans aged 65 and older and makes up another l;arge part of federal spending. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public welfare makes up a significant part of state and local budgets. This consists of transfer and vendor payments made to private purveyors for medical, burials, and other services provided under welfare programs.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A progressive tax system is one in which tax rates increase with taxable base incomes, so that the rich pay higher tax rates than the less well to do. To understand this system more precisely, we need to distinguish between average and marginal tax rates. The average tax rate faced by a household is the total tax paid divided by total income earned. The marginal tax rate refers to how much of the last dollar earned the household pays in taxes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The alternatives to the progressive tax system are the proportional and regressive tax systems. In a proportional tax system, households pay the same percentage of their incomes in taxes regardless of their income level. In a regressive tax system, the marginal tax and average tax rates decline with income so that low income households pay a greater percentage of income in taxes than do high income households. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of transfer programs and progressive taxation, the post tax income distribution in the US is more equal than the pre tax income distribution. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governments also tax to pay for their own operations, including the salaries of presidents, members of congress, and other politicians, and for the sizable bureaucracy in charge of the day to day running of government operations and services. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government sometimes imposes taxes to correct market failures or externalities. Though important in principle, this use of taxation is far less prevalent than the three reasons discussed above.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term tax incidence refers to how the burden of the tax is distributed across various agents in the economy. The incidence on producers is the portion of tax revenue that lies above the pre-tax equilibrium price, is given by the same green triangle. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadweight loss of taxation is the loss in total surplus or the decline in consumer and producer surpluses not made up by the increase in tax revenues. The deadweight losses of taxation imply that for every dollar of tax raised, the cost is greater than a dollar. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In competitive markets, tax incidence and equilibrium prices and quantities are independent of whether the tax is imposed on consumers or producers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that the incidence of the tax is identical for buyers and sellers in the examples above is due to how we drew the market demand and market supply curves. So, that means buyers and sellers are equally sensitive to price changes at the original equilibrium. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Externalities and various market failures can have significant social costs. The main tool that governments use to deal with externalities and other sources of market failures is regulation. Regulation refers to actions by the federal or local government directed at influencing market outcomes, such as the quantity traded of a good or service, its price, or its quality of safety. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common form of government intervention in markets is direct regulation. Direct regulation refers to direct actions by the government to control the amount of a certain activity. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A price ceiling is a cap on the price of a market good or service. One important example is rent control. A price ceiling causes a shortage.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes the government steps in to impose a minimum price on a  product or service. The result is a price floor, which represents a lower limit on the price of the product or service. A good example of a price floor is the minimum wage.  A price floor causes a surplus. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every government program needs bureaucrats to monitor its implementation and these people have to be paid. However, they are taken out of productive sectors of the economy. In this way, the allocation of time and talent of individuals to bureaucracy is an important cost of government. This cost is increased by the fact that bureaucracies don’t function efficiently. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equally as important as the deadweight losses associated with government intervention and the inefficiencies of bureaucracies is the corruption that large governments engender. Corruption refers to the misuse of public funds or the distortion of the allocation of resources for personal gain. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The underground economy, or black market, includes activities where income taxes are not paid, as well as illegal activities such as drug dealing and prostitution. In modern economies, black markets cover an array of activities and are generally found in areas where the benefits of such activities are the highest. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problems of an underground economy are:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it involves goods and services that have been legally banned, the underground economy undermines the ban.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When underground transactions occur in markets for legal goods and services in order to avoid taxes or regulation, they put legitimate businesses at a disadvantage. </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To compensate for the lost revenue, governments must levy higher taxes</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criminals spend vast resources trying to evade the law, which are not effective uses of society’s resources.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The equity-efficiency-trade-off refers to the balance between ensuring an equitable allocation of resources and increasing social surplus or total output. Most would agree that equity and efficiency are the two most important goals for government policy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trade-off between equity and efficiency represents the nub of the conflict between those who support big government and those who call for smaller government. The government can often achieve greater social equality but only at the expense of greater inefficiencies. When social inequality is very high, there may be no conflict between equity and efficiency. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity and efficiency are two opposites. To have one means you lose the other. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All developed nations seek to achieve some degree of equality in their society. The welfare state refers to the set of insurance, regulation, and transfer programs utilized to create a safety net, reduce poverty, and redistribute income from the rich to the poor. The welfare state is even more expansive in Europe. Despite deadweight losses associated with their systems, many European nations choose to promote some degree of equality in income. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer sovereignty is the view that choices made by a consumer reflect his or her true preferences, and outsiders, including the government, should not interfere with these choices. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the other end of the spectrum is paternalism. Paternalism is the view that consumers do not always know what is best for them, and the government should encourage or induce them to change their actions. This approach gives the government an active hand in designing choices to help individuals make the right decision. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The social security system in the US, which forces individuals to save for old age, was born out of paternalism. Laws that ban substance abuse are also motivated by paternalism. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we have shown, a major efficiency loss of taxation is deadweight loss. So, the debate on the reach of the government should hinge on the effect of its actions, the larger the deadweight loss, the worse the policy.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government typically operates in a slow moving manner. A significant drag on the economy can result if regulators cannot move swiftly in response to changing market conditions. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governments can play an important role in ensuring that markets are competitive, efficient, and equitable. Key roles of the government include taxation to raise funds to provide public goods, such as national defense, policing, and infrastructure investments that would not be provided adequately by the market. The use of tax and transfer programs to achieve a more equitable distribution of resources in society and the use of taxes and subsidies as well as regulation to correct market failures. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The costs of government interventions must be compared carefully with their benefits. Economics is most useful not as a value judgment on whether the government is good or bad, but for understanding what sorts of activities require government intervention. </span></p><p><br><br><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary types of tax systems are:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressive</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proportional</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regressive</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of a progressive tax is the:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Income tax</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of a regressive tax is the:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social security tax</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of a proportional tax is the:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicare tax</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax incidence refers to:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who bears the burden of a tax</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the entire burden of the tax always borne by those on whom is is imposed?:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not necessarily, since the burden of the tax depends on price elasticity.

Firms derive the demand for labor by determining the value of marginal product of labor. The supply of labor is determined by trading off the marginal benefit from labor given earnings against the marginal cost, the value of forgone leisure.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wage inequality can be attributed to differences in human capital, differences in compensating wages, and discrimination in the job market. In addition to labor, a producer must derive the demand for physical capital and land to achieve its production objectives. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market for labor is of particular importance in the economy because it affects all of us. The market for labor is composed of suppliers and demanders. Workers produce goods and services and therefore are known as factors of production. Remember that a factor of production is used in the production of other goods.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Markets for factors of production are somewhat different from markets for goods and services that we consume, because the demand for factors of production is delivered from the demand for final goods and services. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although firms tend to use many factors of production, the main factors that we will focus on are labor, machines, and land.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the market for labor, the roles of demander and supplier are reversed: businesses are buyers of labor and individual workers are suppliers of labor.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All firms rely on labor as a major factor of production. Workers operate machines and often perform tasks more efficiently than machines. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law of diminishing returns states that the marginal productivity of an additional unit of labor eventually decreases as we increase the number of workers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The value of marginal product of labor is the contribution of an additional worker to a firm’s revenues. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have now seen two ways to maximize profits.</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose the total quantity of production in order to maximize profits, so expand production until marginal cost=price</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimally choosing its labor by expanding its workforce until the marginal product of labor * price = vmpl=wage</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To construct the market supply curve, we need to aggregate the individual labor supply curves. To do this, we horizontally sum the individual labor supply curves. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The substitution effect implies that when the price of leisure increases, people will substitute working for relaxing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several key determinants of where the labor demand curve will be situated. Two important factors are:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price of the good that the firm is producing</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology of the firm</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A labor saving technology is a type of technology that substitutes for existing labor inputs, reducing the marginal product of labor. Labor-complementary technologies are those that complement existing labor inputs, increasing the marginal product of labor.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shifts in labor supply also affect equilibrium wage and employment levels. We discuss three main factors that shift labor supply:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Population changes</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changes in worker preferences and tastes</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opportunity costs</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three important features of the labor market that may give rise to differences in wages across workers:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Differences in human capital</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Differences in compensating wages</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discrimination in the job market</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One explanation for the wage difference is that people have very different levels of skills and therefore different levels of productivity. Economists refer to each person’s stock of skills for producing output or economic value as human capital. Differences in human capital result in differences in wages.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wage differences that are used to attract workers to otherwise undesirable occupations are known as compensating wage differentials. Wage differentials based on risk and unpleasantness are important factors to consider when examining wage differences across jobs, but there are also reasons we may see workers in the same job getting paid differently. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A third major factor in determining wages in the labor market is the nature and extent of discrimination that is present. Economists have pinpointed two major theories for why employers might discriminate, taste-based and statistical discrimination. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taste-based discrimination occurs when people’s preferences cause them to discriminate against a certain group. It is important to note that wages can be different between groups not only because an employer has a taste for discrimination but also because of other factors like human capital. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistical discrimination occurs when employers use an observable variable to help determine whether the person will be a good employee. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology can be either labor saving or labor complementary. It can also be skill saving or skill complementary. Skill biased technological changes increase the productivity of skilled workers relative to that of unskilled workers. The primary technological change over this time period has been advances in computing power. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite our focus so far on labor as an input to production, there are other factors equally important to the production process. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recall that the value to a firm of adding each consecutive unit of labor is given by multiplying the output price and the marginal product of labor.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical capital is any good, including machines and buildings, used for production. A firm will expand its physical capital until it is not worthwhile to do so. The value of marginal product of physical capital is the contribution of an additional unit of physical capital to a firm’s revenues.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same is true for uses of land. Land includes the solid surface of the earth where structures are built and natural resources. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the economic framework for deciding how much of the three inputs to use is identical, labor has one major difference from physical capital and land: both physical capital and land can be either rented or owned, whereas labor cannot be owned. When rented, the firm must pay the rental price of physical capital, and to use land it must pay the rental price of land. By rental price, we mean the price of using a good for a specific period of time. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Producers determine the optimal mix of labor, physical capital, and land when making production decisions. Markets for these factors of production operate in much the same way that markets for final goods and services function. Firms expand their use until marginal benefits equal marginal costs. Determining the demand for labor centers on the concept of the value of marginal product of labor, which is the contribution an additional worker makes to the firm’s revenues.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When making decisions on how to spend our time, we face opportunity costs. There is a trade-off between labor, which comprises activities that earn money, and leisure, which is time spent on activities other than earning money. The opportunity cost for one hour of leisure is the income that we would have earned by working for that one hour.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Large wage differences exist across people and jobs. The differences stem from three main sources: human capital differences, compensating wage differentials, and discrimination. As with labor, firms expand their use of physical capital until the value of the marginal product equals the price of physical capital, and they likewise use land until the value of the marginal product of land equals the price of land. </span></p><p><br><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose that at your firm the relationship between output produced and the number of workers you hire is as in the following table.</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marginal product = 18, 14, 10, 9, 5, 4</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the relationship between output and labor consistent with the law of diminishing returns?</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the marginal product declines as successive units of labor are hired</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose your firm is a perfect competitor in the output market and the labor market.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the price of output is $7 and the wage rate is $28, your firm should hire:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 workers</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the price output falls to $2 and the wage remains $28, your firm should hire:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 workers</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider a businessman that owns three different coffee shops with production functions shown below.

Compared to competitive firms, monopolists produce less and charge more. They make themselves better off, with the potential of earning economic profits in both the short run and the long run. But their gain will come at the cost of making consumers worse off and decreasing social surplus. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monopoly represents an extreme market structure with a single seller. Monopolies arise both naturally and through government protection. Monopolists are price-makers and produce at the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The monopolist profits by producing a lower quantity and charging a higher price than perfectly competitive sellers. The result is a deadweight loss. Efficiency can be established in a monopoly through first-degree price discrimination or government intervention. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studying perfectly competitive markets provided important insights into how agents interact in markets and how markets equilibrate. But it proves to be a special type of market. A more common market situation is one in which a firm is not simply a price-taker, but a price-maker, a seller that sets the price of a good. Such a firm has the ability to set the price of the good because it has market power. The most extreme form of market power is a monopoly.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A monopoly is an industry structure in which only one seller provides a good or service that has no close substitutes. In this way, a monopolist is not concerned with the behavior of other sellers. The price chosen by the monopolist is the one that makes the company the highest profit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ability of a company to control a market, to gain market power, relies on barriers to entry. Barriers to entry are obstacles that prevent potential competitors from entering the market. As such, they provide the seller protection against competition. Barriers to entry range from complete exclusion of market entrants to prevention of a new firm from entering and competing on an equal footing with the incumbent firm. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two types of market power arise from barriers to entry, legal market power and natural market power. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A firm has legal market power when it obtains market power through barriers to entry created not by the firm itself but by the government. These barriers can take the form of patents and copyrights that are issued to innovative companies. With a patent, the government grants an individual or company the sole right to produce and sell a good or service. With a copyright, the government grants an individual or company an exclusive right to intellectual property. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second common source of barriers to entry occur naturally rather than by design. Natural market power occurs when a firm obtains market power through barriers to entry created by the firm itself. There are two main types:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monopolist owns or controls a key resource for production</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are economies of scale in production over the relevant range of output</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key resources are those materials that are essential for the production of a good or service. The most basic way for a firm to develop market power naturally is to control the entire supply of such resources. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another key resource is individual expertise. Network externalities occur when a product;s value increases as more consumers begin to use it. Monopolies also form because it is practical for both producers and consumers. Natural monopolies are characterized by substantial fixed costs and economies of scale. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For goods and services that have economies of scale over the relevant range of output, it is efficient for a single firm to serve the entire market, because it can do so at a lower cost than any larger number of firms could. We denote such cases as natural monopolies, because they arise naturally. A natural monopoly arises because the economies of scale of a single firm make it efficient to have only one provider of a good or service. Often such firms are the first suppliers in a given market, and the cost advantages they achieve through producing a large number of goods preclude would-be competitors from entering the market. Examples of natural monopolies include providers of clean drinking water, natural gas, and electricity. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast to monopolies that arise through legal means, natural monopolies emerge when unique cost conditions characterize their industry. Because of these conditions, natural monopolists worry less about potential market entrants than do monopolies that arise through legal means.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monopolist’s problem shares two important similarities with the perfectly competitive seller’s problem. First, the monopolist must understand how inputs combine to make outputs. Second, the monopolist must know the costs of production. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do find one important difference between the perfectly competitive seller’s decision problem and the monopolist’s decision problem. To maximize profits, the perfectly competitive firm expands production until marginal cost equals price, where price is determined by the intersection of the market demand and market supply curves. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">  This situation represents the major difference between the perfectly competitive firm’s decision problem and the monopolist’s decision problem. Because the monopolist is the sole market supplier, it faces the market demand curve, which is downward-sloping. Unlike the perfectly competitive firm, the monopolist can increase price and not lose all of its business. In fact, the market demand curve tells us exactly the trade-off the monopolist faces when it changes its price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High fixed costs are typical for industries that spend large amounts of money on researching and developing products, such as pharmaceutical companies. In such instances, it is not uncommon for marginal cost to be constant over large ranges of output, because mass production of the product leads to each additional unit of production to have a constant additional cost per unit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfectly competitive firm must consider both marginal cost and marginal revenue when making its production decision. A monopolist is no different. This reasoning shows that your profit-maximizing level of output produced is given by the intersection of the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your pricing decision as a monopolist is critically linked to the nature of the market demand curve. Price is set at a level higher than marginal costs for a monopolist, whereas price is equal to marginal cost for a perfectly competitive firm. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In perfectly competitive markets, entry causes long-run economic profits to be zero. For a monopoly, economic profits remain. This is because there is no threat of entry from competitors because of barriers to entry. Therefore, no new entrants threaten to increase supply and push the price down to eliminate economic profits. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monopolists, unlike sellers in competitive markets, do not have a supply curve. To create a supply curve under perfect competition, it is necessary for firms to be price-takers, whose production is based on the given market price. Under this assumption, we simply determine the quantity at which the marginal cost of producing the last unit of a good is equal to the market price. Thus, in a competitive market, a supply curve shows all price and quantity combinations at which firms will produce. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monopolists, as price-makers, do not vary their production based on market price because they set the price. It makes no sense to ask how much of a good a monopolist will produce at a given price. Like sellers in competitive markets, monopolists will produce at the point where their marginal revenue is equal to their marginal cost. Marginal revenue depends on the negatively sloped demand curve that the monopolist faces. Because a monopolist’s production decision is based on demand, it cannot be depicted as an independent supply curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, we learned that the invisible hand creates harmony between individual and social interests. A firm that exercises market power causes a reallocation of resources toward itself, thereby sacrificing social surplus. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price discrimination occurs when firms charge different consumers different prices for the same good or service. First-degree price discrimination is where consumers are charged the maximum price they are willing to pay. Second-degree price discrimination is where consumers are charged different prices based on characteristics of their purchase, such as the quantity they purchase. Third-degree price discrimination is when different groups are charged different prices based on their own attributes, such as age, gender, or location.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In practice, perfect price discrimination is difficult to achieve for two reasons. First, it is hard to charge every consumer a unique price. Second, it is challenging to know every consumer’s willingness to pay. Therefore, other forms of price discrimination are more prevalent in practice. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A monopoly is an industry structure in which only one firm provides a good or service that has no close substitutes. Monopolies arise because of barriers to entry, which take two forms: legal and natural. In the legal form, the government creates the barrier, as with a patent or copyright. In the natural form, control of key resources or achieving economies of scale can result in a natural monopoly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barriers to entry permit the monopolist to exercise market power when making quantity and pricing decisions. The optimal action of the monopolist is to set price &gt; marginal revenue = marginal cost. This differs from a competitive industry, where price=marginal cost=marginal revenue.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In equilibrium, monopoly leads to less quantity and higher prices compared to a perfectly competitive market equilibrium. In this way, because consumers are standing by ready to purchase from the monopolist for a price greater than marginal cost, social surplus is not maximized, leading to a deadweight loss.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monopolies may sometimes be appropriate, and understanding whether a firm is occupying a monopoly status appropriately is a major concern of US lawmakers. Even though there are costs to allowing firms to have monopoly power, the extra profit might translate into better and more productive research and development for new products, medicines, and technologies. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which of the following are properties of a monopoly?</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are high barriers to entry</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price-maker</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is only one seller</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural monopolies are characterized by substantial fixed costs and economies of scale.

The monopoly will want to do this for as many consumers as possible, and will keep producing until the last consumer’s willingness to pay matches the firm’s cost of making that unit.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to a monopoly that does not price discriminate, a monopolist who engages in perfect price discrimination will produce:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More output and have no deadweight loss</span></li></ol><p><br><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As this chapter explains, a monopoly is an industry structure where only one firm provides a good or service that has no close substitutes. This question explores the last part of this definition further. In 1947, the US government charged the DuPont company with a violation of the Sherman Act. The government argued that DuPont was monopolizing the cellophane market. At trial, the government showed that DuPont produced nearly 75 percent of all of the cellophane sold in the US each year. Nonetheless, the US supreme court ruled in favor of DuPont and dismissed the case. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which of the following is a likely argument used by DuPont to convince the supreme court that it did not violate the Sherman Act?</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many close substitutes for cellophane such as aluminum foil and waxed paper, so DuPont did not have significant market power</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sirius XM Satellite Radio and XM Satellite radio were the only two satellite radio providers in the US. The DOJ and the FCC approved the merger of the two companies in 2008 even though Sirius-XM would then control 100 percent of the satellite radio market.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which of the following arguments do you think Sirius and XM used to convince the DOJ and the FCC to allow the merger to proceed?</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many close substitutes for satellite radio, therefore, the Sirius-XM would not exercise market power. </span></li></ol><h2 id="mcetoc_1h7c9aoe7h" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Game Theory and Strategic Play</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The simple economic framework we have developed thus far is not equipped to handl;e situations like these where your payoffs depend on the behavior of others and your behavior affects their payoffs. These situations include, among others, how to allocate scarce resources in partnerships, firms, friendships, and families. You may wonder what economics has to do with friendships and families. It has a lot to do with them.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are important situations when the behavior of others affects your payoffs. Game theory is the economic framework that describes our optimal actions in such settings. A Nash equilibrium is a situation where none of the players can do better by choosing a different action or strategy for themselves. Nash equilibria are applicable to a wide variety of problems, including zero-sum games, the tragedy of the commons, and the prisoner’s dilemma.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game theory is the study of situations in which the payoff of one agent depends not only on his or her actions, but also on the actions of others. It emerged as a branch of mathematics that first focused on the analysis of parlor games. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A payoff matrix represents the payoffs for each action players can take in a game. A best response is simply one player’s optimal strategy, taking the other player’s strategy as given. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a player has the same best response to every possible strategy of the other player, then we say that the player has a dominant strategy. In the prisoner’s dilemma, confessing is a dominant strategy, because it is your best response to any strategy choice of your partner. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, this equilibrium leads to an outcome that is not best for both players. Life doesn’t always present a game that has a dominant strategy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the essence of the equilibrium concept proposed by John Nash, in equilibrium, no player in a game can change strategy and improve his or her payoff. Therefore, a combination of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if each player chooses a strategy that is a best response to the strategies of others, that is, players are choosing strategies that are mutual best responses. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This notion of equilibrium depends on two critical factors: that all players understand the game and the payoffs associated with each strategy and that all players understand that other players understand the game.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to finding Nash equilibria is to determine whether either player has an incentive to change his strategy. It is also a common occurrence in game theory to have more than one Nash equilibrium. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game theory is most often used when a few players make choices that affect each other’s payoffs. The same type of reasoning applies even when the number of players is large. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A zero-sum game means that because one player’s loss is another’s gain, the sum of the payoffs is zero. Applying our method of finding Nash equilibria, we draw the arrows. They show that no Nash equilibrium exists, because no cell in the matrix has two arrows pointing in. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We say that a strategy is dominated if it yields lower payoffs than some other available strategy. It is a basic tenet of game theory that no player should pick a dominated strategy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The games that we have discussed so far all revolve around two players choosing an action simultaneously. Suppose that, instead, one player goes first and the other chooses an action only after seeing how the first player chose. This type of situation, which specifies the order of play, is represented by an extensive-form game.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we can say that an extensive-form game specifies the order of play and payoffs that will result from different strategies and uses a game tree to represent them.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The easiest way of approaching any extensive-form game is to use backward induction. Backward induction is the procedure of solving an extensive-form game by first considering the last mover’s decision. So, backward induction involves starting at the end of a game and solving it backwards. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A commitment is an action that one cannot take back. Commitments, which come before other actions, can change who has the advantage.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game theory provides us with the tools to examine situations when players’ payoffs are intertwined. Whether decisions are made simultaneously or sequentially, game theory is about being able to see the world through the eyes of your opponent and understand the opponents incentives.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key concepts of game theory are best responses and Nash equilibria. A best response is one agent’s optimal strategy taking the other player’s strategy as given. When the same strategy is the best response against any possible strategies of the other players, then it is a dominant strategy. In most games, players do not possess such a dominant strategy, making their best responses depend on the strategy choices of other players.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Nash equilibrium arises if each player chooses a strategy that is a best response to the strategies of other players. Put differently, a Nash equilibrium is a combination of strategies that are mutual best responses.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of Nash equilibrium enables us to make predictions about behavior in a range of situations, including those that can be modeled as the prisoner’s dilemma, the tragedy of the commons, and zero-sum games. It also helps us understand why trustworthy behavior is more likely to emerge when players have reputational concerns. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose there are cable tv companies in your city, Astounding cable and Broadcast cable.

Several important variables, such as the number of firms in the industry, the degree of product differentiation, entry barriers, and the presence or absence of collusion, determine the competitiveness of a market. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coffee and tasty foods are typical examples of differentiated products, which are goods that are similar but are not perfect substitutes. They contrast with homogenous products, which are those goods that are identical and are therefore perfect substitutes. Soybeans grown by different farmers are perfect substitutes, books produced by different authors are not. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industries differ not only in whether their products are differentiated or homogeneous but also in the number of sellers present in the industry. Some industries will have a few sellers, like airlines or cable tv. Other industries will have many sellers, like the book or music industries. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between the two extremes of perfect competition and monopoly, there are oligopoly and monopolistic competition. In oligopoly, only a few firms are competing, which could be in the context of either homogeneous or differentiated products. In monopolistic competition, many firms sell differentiated products, and each enjoys some degree of market power. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our first new market structure is oligopoly, which applies when there are only a few suppliers of a product. They can feature either homogeneous or different products. Because in an oligopoly only a few firms are operating, each firm’s profits and profit-maximizing choices depend on other firms’ actions.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our second new market structure is monopolistic competition. The name reflects the basic tension between market power and competitive forces that exists in this market type. All firms in a monopolistically competitive industry face a downward-sloping demand curve, so they have market power and choose their own price. What’s competitive about such markets is that there are no restrictions on entry, any number of firms can enter the industry at any time. This means that firms in a monopolistically competitive industry, despite having pricing power, make zero economic profits in the long run. Similar to a perfectly competitive industry, monopolistic competition features many competing firms, but unlike perfect competition, the sellers produce and sell different products. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will see that oligopolies can be usefully divided into two categories, those that sell homogeneous goods and those that sell different goods. The first model, oligopoly with identical products, is similar to the monopoly model, but one key difference is that the oligopolist must recognize the behavior of its competitors, whereas the monopolist does not. The second model, oligopoly with different products, is linked to the monopolistic competition market structure with one major exception, entry is impeded in the oligopoly, whereas there is free entry in the monopolistically competitive market. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The oligopolist’s problem shares important similarities with the two market types discussed in previous chapters, perfect competition and monopoly. It has the following features. Due to cost advantages associated with the economies of scale of oligopoly or other barriers to entry, entry and exit will not necessarily push the market to zero economic profits in the long run. Because of relatively few competitors, the sellers that do occupy the market interact strategically.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the simplest cases of oligopoly is an industry with only two competing firms, a duopoly. Two firms can compete against each other and set prices. This model is called the Bertrand competition. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is directly relevant for a firm’s profit-maximizing decisions is not the market demand curve but its residual demand curve, which is the demand that is not met by other firms. This residual demand curve depends on the prices charged by all firms in the market. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a duopoly with homogeneous products, the best response of a firm that has a higher price is to undercut its rival. The Nash equilibrium is often marginal cost. So, in this equilibrium, each of the two companies ends up supplying half of the market, and because both are selling at marginal cost, they both earn zero economic profits. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One important lesson I see from these topics is for a business not to make a homogeneous product, so that it cant easily be price cut down to marginal cost. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, we have seen that with two homogeneous products, two firms competing head to head are sufficient to bring the price down to marginal cost. This is no longer true with different products. In fact, in an oligopoly with different products, firms typically make positive economic profits, and some oligopolies persist in the long run with positive profits because of barriers to entry. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not in the interest of one company to collude if the other is colluding. The standard oligopoly models discussed so far cannot explain such puzzling behavior. To get at the motivations behind the behavior, we must consider a model of collusion. Collusion occurs when rival firms conspire among themselves to set prices or to control production quantities rather than let the free market determine them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One model of how an oligopoly might behave is for all the firms to coordinate and collectively act as a monopolist and then split the monopoly profits among themselves. Jointly acting together to earn monopoly profits is the best an industry can do in terms of profit. Collusion is therefore much more profitable than competition.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We now return to the final major market structure, monopolistic competition. You will recall this market features many firms offering different products. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The residual demand curve facing a monopolistically competitive firm is downward-sloping, much like the demand curve for the monopolist. As a result, the marginal revenue curve is below the demand curve, again just like the marginal revenue curve facing a monopolist.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution to the monopolistic competitor’s problem is identical to the profit-maximizing choice of a monopolist, find where marginal cost equals marginal revenue, drop straight down to find quantity, go straight up to the demand curve, and go left to the y-axis to find the profit-maximizing price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This summary of the optimal decision rule highlights the fact that the decision concerning the relationship between marginal revenue and marginal cost, which determines the level of production, is identical across the three market structures of perfect competition, monopoly, and monopolistic competition: expand production until marginal cost equals marginal revenue. The major difference arises with the firm in a perfectly competitive industry: it faces a perfectly elastic demand curve for its product, which leads to price being equal to marginal revenue. For the monopolistic competitor, however, we have the price being greater than marginal revenue because they face a downward-sloping demand curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to sellers in all market structures, economic profits are not ensured for the seller in a monopolistically competitive industry. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s competitive about monopolistically competitive industries is that there are no restrictions on entry-firms can freely enter and exit the industry at any time. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If total revenues cover variable costs, then continue to produce in the short run. If total revenues do not cover variable costs, then shutdown is optimal, as you will lose less money by shutting down and paying fixed costs than you would by operating. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a perfectly competitive industry, market changes operate through shifts in the market supply curve. In monopolistic competition, market changes occur because the residual demand curve becomes flatter and shifts leftward with entry. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because entry pushes economic profits to zero in the long run, monopolistically competitive firms have an incentive to continually try to distinguish themselves from rivals, so that markets are perpetually in motion. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firms have to continually make new products from their same inputs, to distance themselves from competitors and new entries into the market. Don’t do too much though because these actions cost a lot of money and contribute to long run zero economic profits for firms. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to a competitive market, monopolists will be able to charge a price greater than marginal cost, thereby reducing sales and thus total surplus. This is also the case for oligopolies with different products. In both market structures, firms have market power and are able to charge prices greater than marginal cost, reducing total surplus. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With free entry and exit, economic profits in the long run equilibrium will equal zero. Then firms will exit the market. However, in real life, you will see that firms do not exit the market. That is because they constantly try to innovate and show how their products are different from competitors. This keeps consumers coming and revenue coming. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that monopolistic competitors each have a downward-sloping demand curve causes them to act differently than a perfectly competitive seller. First, they produce at a level that is below the efficient scale of production. Second, they mark up prices above its marginal cost. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allin all, economists favor regulation for monopolies and for highly regulated oligopolies, but are generally comfortable with permitting the more limited market power of monopolistically competitive firms, even though it still reduces total surplus to the economy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we just learned, monopolistic competition and oligopoly share many features with monopolies, including the ability to set prices. The primary difference across these three market structures is the number of competitors, or the number of sellers. A monopoly has only one seller. But monopolistic competition and oligopoly are market structures with more than one seller, and because of this, they have to concern themselves with the actions of the other firms. </span></p><p><br><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oligopoly and monopolistic competition are two market structures that lie between the market extremes of perfect competition and monopoly. Firms in these market structures must consider the behavior of competitors, whereas neither a monopolist nor firms in a perfectly competitive industry need to do so.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No single model of oligopoly is applicable for every situation. The equilibrium will depend on the unique features of the market-whether the goods are homogeneous or different, how many firms are in the industry, and whether collusion is sustainable. Nevertheless, there are some important general lessons from the study of oligopoly. Economic profits of firms will be higher when goods are different, when there are fewer firms in the industry, and when collusion is sustainable.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the short run, behavior of the monopolistic competitor and the monopolist are identical: set price greater than marginal revenue and marginal cost. In the long run, entry and exit cause the equilibrium in a monopolistically competitive industry-zero economic profits-to be identical to equilibrium in perfect competition.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economics provides a useful set of tools to begin a discussion of whether a market is competitive, but there is no one factor-such as the number of firms-that wholly dictates the nature of competition in a specific industry. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How are the products sold by a monopolistically competitive firm different from the products sold in a competitive market?

Bi-Rite is thinking of entering this market. They will play the following game. First, Bi-Rite will decide whether or not to enter. If it does not enter, then the game ends, Acme earns a payoff of 50, and Bi-Rite earns a payoff of 0. If Bi-Rite does enter, then Acme has to decide whether to fight by slashing prices or to accommodate. If Acme decides to fight, then Acme and Bi-Rite each earns -10, if Acme accommodates, then each earns 20.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using backward induction, the Nash equilibrium for Bi-Rite is:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To enter and for Acme to accommodate</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose Acme threatens to fight if Bi-Rite enters.

If they both advertise, they again split the market evenly, but each spends 10 million on ad and so each earns just 40 million. If one company advertises but the other does not, then the company that advertises attracts many of its rivals' customers.

A team is subject to the tax if its payroll exceeds a specified level. The annual threshold for the luxury tax is 189 million. A team that exceeds the threshold must pay 17.5 percent to 50 percent of the amount by which its payroll is above the threshold, where the tax rate depends on the number of years the team is over. This question looks at why teams might subject themselves to this tax.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose there are two major league baseball teams, 1 and 2.

Economists have developed tools to calculate the present value of payments received at different points in the future. Economists have developed tools to calculate the value of risky payments.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most decisions have costs and benefits that occur at different times. Other activities are also associated with up-front costs and delayed benefits. In general, almost all investments have risky returns.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key variable that summarizes an intertemporal transformation of money is the interest payment.  The amount of an original investment is referred to as principal. Interest is the payment received for temporarily giving up the use of one’s money. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sum of the principal and interest is known as future value. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ (1 + r) * 100 \]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are collecting interest for multiple years, it is called compound interest. The compound interest equation looks like:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">\[ (1 + r)^{T} * (Principal) \]</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this equation, r is the interest rate and T is the number of years that the investment lasts. To derive the compound interest equation, we assume that none of your interest payments are being withdrawn along the way. So, you earn interest on past interest payments. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making a deposit effectively transfers spending from the present to the future. You deposit money now, and you withdraw it in the future. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The present value of a future payment is the amount of money that would need to be invested today to produce that future payment. Economists say that the present value is the discounted value of the future payment. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discounting brings back money to the present and involves a reduction in magnitude, compounding takes money into the future and involves an increase in magnitude. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists say that this offer has a negative net present value. The net present value of an investment is the present value of the benefits minus the present value of the costs. A positive net present value represents </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The present value concepts are useful tools, because many economic opportunities generate complex streams of future payments. We can now collapse all those future payments to a single number-the net present value of the project.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net present value is one of the most important tools in economics and is universally used by businesses and governments to decide which projects to implement. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We just showed you how to discount future monetary payments to calculate a present value. We can also discount other future activities. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose there is some future activity that will generate pleasure or some other form of well-being. Suppose that this benefit is not money. Economists refer to general well-being as utility. To make future utility comparable to current utility, we need to multiply the future utility by a factor less than 1. In general, this won’t be exactly the same factor that we used for monetary payments. However, both the factors that multiplicatively discount future monetary payments and the factors that multiplicatively discount future utility are less than 1. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting discount weights for activities is kind of arbitrary, but the process is to illustrate a point of how the process goes. The greater your discount weight-the more highly you weigh things that happen in the future-the more your current decisions are driven by the future consequences of those decisions. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most economists do not have a view on what discount weights you should have. The discount weights reflect your tastes. If you sharply devalue things that occur in the future, you have low future discount weights. If you care about the future as much as the present, you have future discount weights that are close to 1. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To an economist, risk exists when outcomes are not known with certainty in advance. Risk can even exist if all possible outcomes are good outcomes. If something is risky, then it is said to have a component that is random. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A probability is the frequency with which something occurs. The probability that one of N particular numbers comes up is N/100. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When two outcomes are independent, knowing about one outcome does not help you predict the other outcome. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have had an introduction to probabilities, we can put these ideas to work. We are going to calculate an expected value, which is the sum of all possible outcomes or values, each weighted by its probability of occurring.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Empirical evidence reveals that many people actually are extremely averse to the chance of a small financial loss and are therefore willing to buy expensive insurance to reduce the risk of such losses. Loss aversion is the idea that people psychologically weight a loss much more heavily they they psychologically weight a gain. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loss aversion is one important example of a risk preference. In general, economists distinguish three categories of risk preference; risk aversion, risk seeking, and risk neutrality. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people are risk averse, they prefer the investment with the fixed return. When people are risk seeking, they prefer the investment with the risky return. When people are risk neutral, they don’t care about the level of risk and are therefore indifferent between the two investments. Thousands of empirical studies have shown that people are risk averse in most situations. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most decisions have benefits and costs that occur at different times. To optimize, economic agents need to translate all benefits and costs into a single time period, so they can be compared.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interest is the payment received for temporarily giving up the use of money. The present value of a future payment is the amount of money that would need to be invested today to produce that future payment. The net present value of a project is the present value of the benefit minus the present value of the costs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utility is a measure of satisfaction or well-being. Utils are individual units of utility. A discount weight multiplies delayed utils to translate them into current utils. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risk means that some of the costs and benefits are not fixed in advance. A probability is the frequency with which something occurs. For example, a probability of 0.12 means that the event will happen 12 percent of the time on average. An expected value is a probability-weighted value.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loss aversion is the property that people psychologically weight a loss much more heavily then they psychologically weight a gain. If two investments have the same expected return, but one investment has a fixed return and the other investment has a risky return, people with risk aversion prefer the investment with the fixed return. </span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1h7j7fkrr8" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>The Economics of Information</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asymmetric information means that one party has superior information to another party. In many markets, buyers and sellers have different information, which can lead to market inefficiencies. Asymmetry in information is due to either hidden characteristics or hidden actions. In cases with hidden characteristics, agents can use their private information to decide whether to participate in a transaction or a market, causing adverse selection.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In cases with hidden actions, an agent can take an action that adversely affects another agent, causing moral hazard. There are both private and government solutions to reduce the effects of adverse selection and moral hazard. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon some reflection, you will find that life presents many interactions in which one party to a transaction has different information from the other-information that the other party cares about. We refer to such discrepancies in knowledge between buyers and sellers as asymmetric information. We also say that the party with information that the other party to the transaction does not possess has private information. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can distinguish two kinds of asymmetric information. First, hidden characteristics, in which one party in a transaction observes some characteristics of the good or service that the other doesn’t observe. Second, hidden action, in which one party in a transaction takes actions that are relevant for, but not observed by, the other party. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If information gaps are large enough, it is possible in theory for a market to completely shut down, even if everyone could benefit from trade. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both types of asymmetric information can have profound impacts on markets. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adverse selection occurs when one agent in a transaction knows about a hidden characteristic of a good and decides whether to participate in the transaction on the basis of this private information. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A warranty is an example of signaling, in which an individual with private information takes action, sends a signal, to convince someone without the information that his services or his products are high quality. The idea is that warranties are particularly expensive for low quality products, because these tend to break down more often. But low quality producers shy away from offering warranties because it will end up too expensive for them to make good on the warranties when their products die. So the fact that any particular item has a warranty means the item is high quality and you do not need to buy an extended warranty. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Used cars sell for about 20 to 40 percent less than new cars of the same year and model, particularly when they are not certified by dealers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hidden actions occur when an agent does not observe relevant actions taken by another agent with whom he is transacting. When hidden actions on the part of one agent influence another agent’s payoffs, we say that there is a moral hazard. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People tend to take more risks if they don’t have to bear the costs of their behavior. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The party with the hidden action is the agent. The uninformed party, who can design a contract before the agent chooses his actions, is the principal. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under moral hazard, the uninformed party can sometimes design a contract to incentivize the party with private information. Economists refer to such relationships as a principal-agent relationship. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efficiency wages refer to wages above the lowest pay workers will accept. Employers use the higher wage to increase productivity. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higher-paid workers might wish to work harder because a higher-paying job is more valuable to them, and the risk of not succeeding in this job-and thus having to quit or be fired-becomes potentially more costly.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higher wages might encourage workers to stay longer with the company, reducing turnover and thus the costs the employers will incur for recruiting and training new employees. Moreover, the longer employment relationships that result with low turnover might increase worker productivity through experience effects. Higher wages might thus increase profits via both channels.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Higher pay might motivate the worker psychologically. For example, workers who perceive generosity from their employers might perceive this as a gift and reciprocate by working harder at their jobs-a phenomenon sometimes dubbed gift exchange in the economics literature. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government can improve equity, but often at the cost of reduced efficiency. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists understand that some amount of unemployment has always existed in market economies and is largely unavoidable. It takes time for workers to find jobs suited to their skills and interests.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moral hazard is present in the problem facing unemployed workers because an individual’s efforts to find a job and decision whether to take an offer are private information. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The presence of moral hazard in the behavior of unemployed workers introduces an unavoidable trade-off in the design of unemployment benefits, greater equity and insurance for unemployed workers and their families come at the cost of reducing worker effort to find new jobs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problems of asymmetric information are relevant not only when governments engage in redistribution, as in the unemployment case, but also when they try to enforce law and order. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government rules are everywhere. All states enforce laws, uphold property rights, and prevent crimes. If they did not, society would have to suffer through the detrimental actions of quite a few bad apples. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many real world markets are characterized by asymmetric information because of important information disparities between buyers and sellers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One type of asymmetric information is driven by hidden characteristics, meaning that certain characteristics are hidden from either buyers or sellers. Hidden characteristics lead to adverse selection when agents can use their private information to decide whether to participate in a transaction.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another type of asymmetric information is due to hidden actions, which arise when one party to a transaction can take actions not observed by the other party that affect everyone’s payoffs. Hidden actions lead to moral hazard problems.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the market has developed means to deal with information asymmetries-such as warranties, deductibles, certification, and efficiency wages-in many situations, these may be insufficient, and government intervention may be useful to limit the inefficiencies that asymmetric information creates. </span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1h8kuost08" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Auctions and Bargaining</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Auctions are increasingly used to sell goods and services. There are four major types of auctions: English, Dutch, first-priced, and second-price auctions. Economic theory predicts that under certain assumptions they yield identical revenues for the seller. Bargaining is another frequent way that goods and services are exchanged. Bargaining power importantly determines the terms of exchange.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An open-outcry auction is an auction in which bids are public.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many kinds of auctions. Auctions can usually be split along two features: </span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How people place their bids</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How price is determined</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A sealed-bid auction is one in which bidders place their bids privately, so that no other bidder knows the bid of a participant. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An English auction is an open-outcry auction in which price increases until there is only one standing bid. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Dutch auction is an open-outcry auction in which the price decreases until a bidder stops the auction. The bidder who stops the auction wins the item and  pays the bid. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A first-price auction is an auction in which bidders privately submit bids at the same time. The highest bidder wins the item and pays an amount equal to the bid. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second-price auction is an auction in which bidders privately submit bids at the same time. The highest bidder wins the item and pays an amount equal to the second highest bid. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revenue equivalence theorem states that under certain assumptions, the four auction types are expected to raise the same revenues.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bargaining power describes the relative power an individual has in negotiations with another individual. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases the interactions of buyers and sellers has a role in determining the price of the item being traded. For this reason, studying auctions and bilateral bargaining expands our understanding of how resources are allocated. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are four common auctions:English, Dutch, first-price, and second-price auctions. Though these auctions work very differently and optimizing behaviors vary considerably among them, under certain assumptions the outcomes they yield have some remarkable similarities. In particular, with all of these auction formats, the buyer with the higher valuation wins the item being auctioned, and the expected revenue of the seller is the same.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bargaining power of an individual is critical in determining whether and at what price the trade will take place.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In situations where the coase theorem applies, the distribution of bargaining power will not affect whether the efficient outcome is reached, but it will determine how the gains from this outcome are divided.</span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1hh9046gbk" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Social Economics</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The foundations for demand curves include what you want, prices of goods and services, and how much money you have to spend. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helping others has become very important in modern economics. A lot of people volunteer in developed countries. Giving money to causes is also a popular way to help others. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists view the reasons for giving as falling into two broad categories, to help others and to help one self. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pure altruism is a behavior with a primary motivation to help others. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impure altruism is a behavior with a primary motivation to make oneself feel good. It is primarily motivated by selfish considerations. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairness is the willingness of individuals to sacrifice their own well-being to either improve on the well-being of others or punish those whom they perceive as behaving unkindly. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peer effects are the influence of the decisions of others on our own choices. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herding is a behavior of individuals who conform to the decisions of others. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An information cascade occurs when people make the same decisions as others, ignoring their own private information. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing in economics dictates that agents must value only material worth. Introspection suggests that we value many things beyond wealth, including charity, fairness, trust, revenge, and how others perceive us. Our economic tools provide us with an understanding of when such considerations have importance.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists have also explored how predictions in economics change when we consider an agent who acts more human. Our economic reasoning remains intact when we add such considerations. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this way, predictions from the standard economic model are quite robust and help us study features of our economy such as fairness, revenge, charity, trust, and peer effects. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taken together, these factors help us understand the world around us and how economics can be extended to every corner of our economy.  </span></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1hotg0l58m" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Introduction to Finance</strong></span></h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finance is the study of risk and return. There is always a trade-off between the two. There are three main areas of finance:</span></p><p> </p><ol><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investments</span></li><li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial markets</span></li></ol><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Role of Finance in an Organization</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The accounting department creates financial statements and the finance department implements the firm’s objectives. Finance is responsible for budgeting and forecasting. Finance aids in establishing firm objectives and is responsible for meeting with creditors, lenders, owners, regulators, and other stakeholders that provide capital to the firm or have a claim against firm assets.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finance has many functions within an organization. There are several titles to indicate this:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comptroller</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treasurer</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CFO</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial planning is critical to any organization, large or small. It allows a firm to understand the past and present needs required to satisfy all interested parties.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forecasting and budgeting are common practices for businesses and individual households. These activities are useful for businesses and individuals alike. Financial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify the differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those changes. The budgeting process develops financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and balance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives and serve as a warning if firms are falling short.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Importance of Data and Technology</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the data used in business today has been available for many years. However, data today is more attainable than ever due to technological advancements facilitating a user’s ability to gather, evaluate, and store information faster and more cost effectively than ever. Information is continually available, so the quicker and less expensively firms can adjust to the arrival of new information, the more valuable they become for their stakeholders.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial data is important for internal and external analysis of business firms. More accurate and timely data leads to better business and financial decision-making. Outsiders also use publicly available data about firms to make purchasing, investment, credit, and regulatory decisions. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial statements provide some of the data needed for decision-making. Firms summarize data and develop at least three essential financial statements or reports.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The income statement summarizes the flow of revenues and expenses over a specified period. Statements of cash flow identify actual receipt and use of cash over a period. Balance sheets show the existing assets, liabilities, and equity as of a particular date.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data digitization makes the storage and transmission of data easier and more cost effective. Some data starts out as digital data, such as that from a Microsoft suite product. Data storage has changed significantly in the last decade as companies have moved the storage of digital data  to the cloud. </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Careers in Finance</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Careers in finance are plentiful, fulfilling, and well compensated. Introductory positions are available in areas such as data collection and data entry. More skill and experience is required for roles such as data analysis and forecasting. Eventually, executive-level positions such as CFO present themselves to the most qualified. Finance careers are not limited to financial firms, as understanding finance is an important skill in government regulatory positions, nonprofit management, and all types of commercial business.</span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Markets and Participants</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial markets are where buyers and sellers of financial securities come together to trade. The trading of securities allows markets to value assets and signal value as new information arrives. Brokers operate by bringing buyers and sellers together to receive commissions. Dealers trade from their own portfolios and are often willing to make markets for specific securities by agreeing to buy or sell at the current bid and ask prices. Financial intermediaries actually change or create new financial products.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary market is the market for new securities and the secondary market is the market for used securities. For example, the stock markets trade equity offerings or initial public offerings into the market. Some transactions in the equity market are for the purchase and sale of new securities. Extensive primary market transactions take place weekly, when the Treasury department auctions billions of dollars of new Treasury securities.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key market players in Finance include dealers, brokers, financial intermediaries, the average person. Each of these players facilitates the exchange of products, information, and capital in different ways. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial dealers own the securities that they buy or sell. When a dealer engages in a financial transaction, they are trading from their own portfolio. Brokers act as facilitators in a market, and they bring together buyers and sellers for a transaction. Brokers differ from dealers who buy and sell from their own portfolio of holdings. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the world of stockbrokers, you may work with a discount broker or a full service broker. The fees and expenses are quite different. A discount broker executes trades for clients. Brokers are required for clients because security exchanges require membership in the exchange to accept orders. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full service brokers offer more services and charge higher fees and commissions than discount brokers. Full service brokers may offer investment advice, retirement planning, and portfolio management. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A financial intermediary such as a commercial bank or mutual fund investment company, serves as an intermediary to enable easier and more efficient exchanges among transacting parties. For instance, a commercial bank accepts deposits from savers and investors and creates loans from borrowers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial institutions usually facilitate financial intermediation. However, occasionally lenders and borrowers are able to initiate transactions without the help of a financial intermediary. The advantages of a robust network of financial intermediaries are many. They add efficiency to the financial system through lower transaction costs.  </span></p><p> </p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to understand the how and why of human, physical, and financial capital allocation. Microeconomics is the study of factors affecting an individual’s consumption, and macroeconomics is the study of all the aggregate factors affecting an economy. Economics is important in finance due to the number of economic variables critical to good financial forecasting.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the business setting, finance is the intersection of economics and accounting. Financial decision makers rely on economic theory and empirical evidence combined with accounting data to make informed decisions for their organization. We typically separate economics into two major areas, microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics is devoted to the study of these decisions of allocation by individual businesses, persons, or organizations. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas microeconomics studies the decisions of individuals, macroeconomics examines the decisions of groups. Macroeconomics areas of study and concern include inflation, income, economic growth, and unemployment. To make financial forecasts, managers need good information to understand the relationship among several economic variables. Working from small to large, sales forecasts estimate the likely price and quantity of goods sold. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unemployment rate helps inform financial forecasters about the expected cost of labor and the ability of employers to hire people if a firm plans to increase the production of goods and services. The stock market is a forward looking macroeconomic variable and measures investor expectations about future cash flows and economic growth.  Each of the variables we have identified-inflation, interest rates, unemployment, economic growth, the stock market, and government fiscal policy-are macroeconomic factors.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common view to understanding economics states that macroeconomics is a top-down approach and microeconomics is a bottom up approach. Financial decision makers need to see both the forest and the individual trees to chart a course and move toward a strategic objective.  </span></p><p><br><br></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Financial Instruments</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maturity is one method to differentiate among financial instruments. Using this methodology, we have money markets and capital markets. Money markets consist of short-term marketable securities, and capital markets focus on longer-term securities such as bonds and stocks.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The money market is the market for short term, low risk, and highly liquid securities. Financial institutions, corporations, and governments that have short-term borrowing and lending needs issue securities in the money market. Most of the transactions are quite large, with typical amounts in excess of $100,000. Treasury bills are short-term debt instruments issued by the federal government. T-bills are auctioned weekly by the treasury department through the trading window of the federal reserve bank of New York. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commercial paper is a short term unsecured debt security issued by corporations and financial institutions to meet short term financing needs such as for inventory and receivables. For example, credit card companies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount with the face value as the repayment amount. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negotiable certificates of deposit are very large cd’s issued by financial institutions. They are redeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market. Ncd’s differ in some important ways from the typical cd you may be familiar with from your local bank or credit union. The typical cd has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and is protected by deposit insurance. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market for federal funds is notable because the federal reserve targets the equilibrium interest rate on federal funds as one of its most important monetary policy tools. The federal funds market traditionally consists of the overnight borrowing and lending of immediately available funds among depository financial institutions. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The capital market is the market for longer-term financial instruments. The capital market is similar to the money market. However, maturities are longer, default risk varies to a greater degree from low to high. The federal government issues treasury notes and bonds to raise money for current spending and to repay past borrowing. Treasury notes are US government debt instruments with maturities of 2 to 10 years. The treasury auctions  notes on a regular basis, and investors may purchase new notes from Treasurydirect.gov in the same way they would a T-bill. Longer term Treasury issues, treasury bonds, have maturities of 20 or 30 years. T-bonds are like T-notes in that they pay semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the security and pay the face value at maturity.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State and local governments and taxing districts can issue debt in the form of municipal bonds. Local borrowing carries more risk than treasury securities, and default or bankruptcy is unlikely but possible. Just as governments borrow money in the long term from investors, so do corporations. A corporation often issues bonds for longer term financing. An important goal of business executives is to maximize the owner’s wealth. For corporations, shares of stock represent ownership. Ownership of corporations is easily transferable if a company’s stock trades in one of the organized stock exchanges or in the over the counter market. Most of the trading consists of used or previously issued stocks in the over the counter market.</span></p><p><br><br><br></p><p class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Concepts of Time and Value</strong></span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concepts of time and value involve the resolution of conflict between consumption now versus consumption later. Time and value represent the trade-off between risk and expected return. Many financial exercises examine the relationships among time, interest rates, risk, cash flows now, and cash flows in the future.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The choice to spend or save is really a choice between consumption today versus consumption in the future. Economists, investment advisers, your friends, and mine love to discuss the tradeoff of consumption now or later. An important aspect of the tradeoff between saving and spending involves your short, intermediate, and long term goals. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When saving for short term objectives, the safety of the principal invested is important, and the value of compounding returns is minimal compared to longer term investments. Most short term investors have a low tolerance for risk and hope to beat the rate of inflation. An intermediate investment may be to save for a new car or for the down payment for a house. Long term investments have the advantage of enough time to recover from temporary poor performance and the luxury of compounded returns over a long period. Further, long term investments tend to have greater risk and higher expected average annual rates of returns.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Value is a term used frequently in business and especially in economics, accounting, and finance. Accountants track, record, and display value in the form of financial statements and footnotes. The numbers they present are book values and represent what has occurred. Generally, the economic value is at least as great as  the market value or current price of an asset. </span></p><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 17, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://aindien.com/economics/">Economics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Feconomics-essentials.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Feconomics-essentials.html&amp;via=_Aindien&amp;text=Economics%20Basics" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://aindien.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://aindien.com/basics-of-the-cardano-coin.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Basics of the Cardano Coin</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://aindien.com/pictures-not-showing-in-chrome.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Pictures Not Showing In Chrome </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-05-06T15:20" class="feed__date">May 6, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/credit-markets-in-economics.html" class="invert">Credit Markets In Economics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-04-24T11:27" class="feed__date">April 24, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/defining-macroeconomic-aggregates-in-economics.html" class="invert">Defining Macroeconomic Aggregates In Economics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-04-23T18:50" class="feed__date">April 23, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/demand-and-supply-in-economics.html" class="invert">Demand and Supply in Economics</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><style type="text/css">#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }
