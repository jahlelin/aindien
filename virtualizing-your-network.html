It has been great and reliable when I go on trips or when I get on my laptop to write somewhere away from home.</a></p><div> </div><div> </div><div><strong>Virtualization</strong></div><div>The basic idea behind virtualization is to use software to simulate the</div><div>existence of hardware. This powerful idea enables you to run more than one</div><div>independent computer system on a single physical computer system. </div><div> </div><div>Suppose that your organization requires a total of 12 servers to meet its needs.</div><div>You could run each of these 12 servers on a separate computer, in which case you</div><div>would have 12 computers in your server room, or you could use virtualization to</div><div>run these 12 servers on just 2 computers. In effect, each of those computers</div><div>would simulate 6 separate computer systems, each running one of your servers.</div><div> </div><div>Each of the simulated computers is called a virtual machine. For all intents and</div><div>purposes, each virtual machine appears to be a complete, self-contained computer</div><div>system with its own processor, memory, disk drives and so on. </div><div> </div><div>Like a real computer, each virtual machine requires an operating system to do</div><div>productive work. In a typical network server environment, each virtual machine</div><div>runs its own copy of Windows server. The operating system has no idea that its</div><div>running on a virtual machine rather than on a real machine.</div><div> </div><div>Here are a few terms you need to be familiar with if you expect to discuss</div><div>virtualization intelligently:</div><div> </div><div>Host the actual physical computer on which one or more virtual machines</div><div>run</div><div>Bare metal another term for the host computer that runs one or more virtual</div><div>machines</div><div>Guest another term for a virtual machine running on a host</div><div>Guest OS an operating system that runs within a virtual machine.</div><div>Hypervisor the virtualization operating system that creates and runs virtual</div><div>machines.</div><div>Hardware    A layer of of software that acts as a go-between to separate actual</div><div>hardware from the software that interacts with it.</div><div> </div><div><strong>Hypervisors</strong></div><div>At the core of virtualization is a hypervisor, a layer of software that manages</div><div>the creation and execution of virtual machines. A hypervisor provides several</div><div>core functions:</div><div> </div><div>1. It provides a hardware abstraction layer, which virtualizes all the hardware</div><div>resources of the host computer on which it runs.</div><div> </div><div>2. It creates pools of these abstracted hardware resources that can be allocated</div><div>to virtual machines.</div><div> </div><div>3. It creates virtual machines.</div><div> </div><div>4. It manages the execution of its virtual machines, allocating host hardware</div><div>resources as needed to each virtual machine and starting and stopping virtual</div><div>machines when requested by users.</div><div> </div><div>5. It ensures that each virtual machine is completely isolated from all other</div><div>virtual machines, so that if a problem develops in one virtual machine, none of</div><div>the other virtual machines is affected.</div><div> </div><div>6. It manages communication among the virtual machines over virtual networks,</div><div>enabling the virtual machines to connect with each other and with a physical</div><div>network that reaches beyond the host.</div><div> </div><div>There are two basic types of hypervisors:</div><div> </div><div>1. Type-1: A type-1 hypervisor runs directly on the host computer, with no</div><div>intervening operating system. This is the most efficient type of hypervisor</div><div>because it has direct access to the hardware resources of the host system. The</div><div>two best known examples are VMware's ESXi and Hyper-V.</div><div> </div><div>2. A type-2 hypervisor runs as an application within an operating system that</div><div>runs directly on the host computer. Type-2 hypervisors are less efficient than</div><div>type-1 hypervisors because when you use a type-2 hypervisor, you add an</div><div>additional layer of hardware abstraction.</div><div> </div><div>For production use, you should always use type-1 hypervisors because they are</div><div>much more efficient than type-2 hypervisors.</div><div> </div><div><strong>Virtual Disks</strong></div><div>Computers are not the only things that are virtualized in a virtual environment.</div><div>In addition to creating virtual computers, virtualization also creates virtual</div><div>disk storage. Disk virtualization lets you combine a variety of physical disk</div><div>storage devices to create pools of disk storage that you can then parcel out to</div><div>your virtual machines as needed.</div><div> </div><div>Virtualization of disk storage is nothing new. In fact, there are actually</div><div>several layers of virtualization involved in an actual storage environment. At</div><div>the lowest level are the actual physical disk drives. Physical disk drives are</div><div>usually bundled together in arrays of individual drives. This bundling is a type</div><div>of virtualization in that it creates the image of a single large disk drive that</div><div>is not really there. For example, four 2 TB disk drives might be combined in an</div><div>array to create a single 8TB disk drive.</div><div> </div><div>Note that disk arrays are usually used to provide data protection through</div><div>redundancy. This is commonly called RAID, which stands for redundant array of</div><div>independent disks. </div><div> </div><div>One common form of RAID, called RAID-10, lets you create mirrored pairs of disk</div><div>drives so that data is always written to both of the drives in a mirror pair.</div><div>So, if one of the drives in a mirror pair fails, the other drive can carry the</div><div>load. With RAID-10, the usable capacity of the complete array is equal to</div><div>one-half of the total capacity of the drives in the array. </div><div> </div><div>Another common form of RAID is RAID-5, in which disk drives are combined and one</div><div>of the drives in the group is used for redundancy. Then, if any of the drives in</div><div>the array fails, the remaining drives can be used to re-create the data that was</div><div>on the drive that failed. The total capacity of a RAID-5 array is equal to the</div><div>sum of the capacities of the individual drives minus one of the drives. For</div><div>example, an array of four 2TB drives in a RAID-5 configuration has a total</div><div>usable capacity of 6TB.</div><div> </div><div>In a typical virtual environment, the host computers can be connected to disk</div><div>storage in several distinct ways:</div><div> </div><div>1. Local disk storage: In local disk storage, disk drives are mounted directly</div><div>on the host computer and are connected to the host computer via its internal</div><div>disk drive controllers. </div><div> </div><div>2. Storage area network: In a SAN, disk drives are contained in a separate</div><div>device that is connected to the host via a high-speed controller. The difference</div><div>between a SAN and local storage is that the SAN is a separate device. Its high</div><div>speed connection to the host is often just as fast as the internal connection of</div><div>local disk storage, but the SAN includes a separate storage controller that is</div><div>responsible for managing the disk drives.</div><div> </div><div>A typical SAN can hold a dozen or more disk drives and can allow high speed</div><div>connections to more than one host. A SAN can often be expanded by adding one or</div><div>more expansion chassis, which can contain a dozen ore more disk drives each. So,</div><div>a single SAN can manage hundreds of terabytes of disk data.</div><div> </div><div>3. Networked Attached Storage(NAS): This type of storage is similar to a SAN but</div><div>instead of connecting to the hosts via a high speed controller, a NAS connects</div><div>to the host computers via standard ethernet connections and TCP/IP. NAS is the</div><div>least expensive of all forms of disk storage, but it is also the slowest.</div><div> </div><div>Regardless of the way the storage is attached to the host, the hypervisor</div><div>consolidates its storage and creates virtual pools of disk storage, typically</div><div>called data stores. For example, a hypervisor that has access to three 2TB</div><div>RAID-5 disk arrays might consolidate them to create a single 6TB data store.</div><div> </div><div>From this data store, you can create volumes, which are essentially virtual disk</div><div>drives that can be allocated to a particular virtual machine. Then, when an</div><div>operating system is installed in a virtual machine, the operating system can</div><div>mount the virtual machine's volumes to create drives that the operating system</div><div>can access. </div><div> </div><div>For example, let us consider a virtual machine that runs Windows server. If you</div><div>were to connect to the virtual machine, log in, and use Windows Explorer to look</div><div>at the disk storage that is available to the machine, you might see a C: drive</div><div>with a capacity of 100GB. That C: drive is actually a 100GB volume that is</div><div>created by the hypervisor and attached to the virtual machine. The 100GB volume</div><div>is allocated from a data store, which might be 4TB in size. The data store is</div><div>created from disk storage contained in a SAN attached to the host, which might</div><div>be made up of a RAID-10 array consisting of four 2TB physical disk drives.</div><div> </div><div>So, you can see that there are at least four layers of virtualization required</div><div>to make the raw storage available on the physical disk drives available to the</div><div>guest operating system:</div><div> </div><div>1. Physical disk drives are aggregated using RAID-10 to create a unified disk</div><div>image that has built-in redundancy. RAID-10 is the first layer of</div><div>virtualization. This layer is managed entirely by the SAN.</div><div> </div><div>2. The storage available on the SAN is abstracted by the hypervisor to create</div><div>data stores. This is a second layer of virtualization. </div><div> </div><div>3. Portions of a data store are used to create volumes that are then presented</div><div>to virtual machines. Volumes represent a third layer of virtualization.</div><div> </div><div>4. The guest operating system sees the volumes as if they are physical devices,</div><div>which can be mounted and then formatted to create usable disk storage accessible</div><div>to the user. This is the fourth layer of virtualization.</div><div> </div><div>Although it may seem overly complicated, these layers of virtualization give you</div><div>a lot of flexibility when it comes to storage management. New disk arrays can be</div><div>added to a SAN, or a new NAS can be added to the network, and then new data</div><div>stores can be created from them without disrupting existing data stores.</div><div> </div><div>Volumes can be moved from one data store to another without disrupting the</div><div>virtual machines they are attached to. In fact, you can increase the size of a</div><div>volume on the fly, and the virtual machine will immediately see the increased</div><div>storage capacity of its disk drives, without even requiring so much as a reboot.</div><div> </div><div><strong>Network Virtualization</strong></div><div>When you create one or more virtual machines on a host system, you need to</div><div>provide a way for those virtual machines to communicate not only with each other</div><div>but also with the other physical computers on your network.</div><div> </div><div>To enable such connections, you must create a virtual network within your</div><div>virtualization environment. The virtual network connects the virtual machines to</div><div>each other and to the physical network. </div><div> </div><div>To create a virtual network, you must create a virtual switch, which connects</div><div>the virtual machines to each other and to a physical network via the host</div><div>computer's network interfaces. Like a physical switch, a virtual switch has</div><div>ports. When you create a virtual switch, you connect the virtual switch to one</div><div>or more of the host computer's network interfaces. These interfaces are then</div><div>connected with network cable to physical switches, which effectively connects</div><div>the virtual switch to the physical network.</div><div> </div><div>Then, when you create virtual machines, you connect each virtual machine to a</div><div>port on the virtual switch. When all the virtual machines are connected to the</div><div>switch, the vm's can communicate with each other via the switch. And they can</div><div>communicate with devices on the physical network via the connections through</div><div>the host computer's network interfaces.</div><div> </div><div><strong>Benefits of Virtualization</strong></div><div>You might suspect that virtualization is inefficient because a real computer is</div><div>inherently faster than a simulated computer. Although it is true that real</div><div>computers are faster then simulated computers, virtualization technology has</div><div>become so advanced that the performance penalty for running on a virtualized</div><div>machine rather than a real machine is only a few percent.</div><div> </div><div>The small amount of overhead imposed by virtualization is usually more than made</div><div>up for by the simple fact that even the most heavily used servers spend most of</div><div>their time twiddling their digital thumbs, waiting for something to do. In fact,</div><div>many servers spend nearly all their time doing nothing. As computers get faster</div><div>and faster, they spend even more of their time with nothing to do.</div><div> </div><div>Virtualization is a great way to put all this unused processing power to good</div><div>use. Besides this basic efficiency benefit, virtualization has several</div><div>compelling benefits:</div><div> </div><div>1. Hardware Cost: You typically can save a lot of money by reducing hardware</div><div>costs  when you use virtualization.</div><div> </div><div>2. Energy Costs: Many organizations have found that going virtual has reduced</div><div>their overall electricity consumption for server computers by 80 percent.</div><div> </div><div>3. Reduced Downtime: Virtual environments typically have less than nonvirtual</div><div>environments. </div><div> </div><div>4. Recoverability: One of the biggest benefits of virtualization is not the cost</div><div>savings, but the ability to recover quickly from hardware failures.</div><div> </div><div>5. Disaster Recovery: Besides the benefit of recoverability when hardware</div><div>failures occur, an even bigger benefit of virtualization comes into play in a</div><div>true disaster recovery situation. </div><div> </div><div><strong>Choosing Hosts</strong></div><div>Having made the decision to virtualize your servers, you are next faced with</div><div>the task of selecting the host computers on which you will run your virtual</div><div>servers. The good news is that you need to purchase fewer servers than if you</div><div>use physical servers. The not so good news is that you need to purchase really</div><div>good servers to act as hosts, because each host will support multiple virtual</div><div>servers.</div><div> </div><div>1. If possible, purchase at least two hosts, and make sure that each host is</div><div>independently capable of running all your virtual servers.</div><div> </div><div>2. Add up the amount of memory you intend to allocate for each server to</div><div>determine the amount of ram for each host.</div><div> </div><div>3. Do a similar calculation for processor cores</div><div> </div><div>4. Get the best network connections you can afford.</div><div> </div><div>5. Provide redundancy in the host's subcomponents.</div><div> </div><div><strong>Hyper-V</strong></div><div>Virtualization is a complex subject, and mastering the ins and outs of working</div><div>with a full-fledged virtualization system like VMware Infrastructure is a deep</div><div>topic. You can try the free Hyper-V from Microsoft, though. </div><div> </div><div>Although Hyper-V is built into all modern versions of Windows, Hyper-V is not a</div><div>type-2 hypervisor that runs as an application within Windows. Instead, hyper-V</div><div>is a true type-1 hypervisor that runs directly on the host computer hardware.</div><div>This is true even for the Hyper-V versions that are included with desktop</div><div>versions of Windows. </div><div> </div><div>In Hyper-V, each virtual machine runs within an isolated space called a</div><div>partition. Each partition has access to its own processor, ram, disk, network,</div><div>and other virtual resources. </div><div> </div><div>There are two types of partitions in hyper-V: a parent partition and one or more</div><div>child partitions. The parent partition is a special partition that hosts the</div><div>Windows operating system that Hyper-V is associated with. Child partitions host</div><div>additional virtual machines that you create as needed.</div><div> </div><div>When you activate the Hyper-V feature, the hypervisor is installed and the</div><div>existing Windows operating system is moved into a virtual machine that runs in</div><div>the parent partition. Then, whenever you start the host computer, the hypervisor</div><div>is loaded, the parent partition is created, and Windows is started in a virtual</div><div>machine within the parent partition.</div><div> </div><div>Although it may appear that the hypervisor is running within Windows, actually</div><div>the reverse is true: Windows is running within the hypervisor.</div><div> </div><div>In addition to the Windows operating system, the parent partition runs software</div><div>that enables the management of virtual machines on the hypervisor. This includes</div><div>creating new virtual machines, starting and stopping virtual machines, changing</div><div>the resources allocated to existing virtual machines, and moving virtual</div><div>machines from one host to another. </div><div> </div><div><strong>Hyper-V Virtual Disks</strong></div><div>Every Hyper-V virtual machine must have at least one virtual disk associated</div><div>with it. A virtual disk is nothing more than a disk that resides in the file</div><div>system of the host operating system. The file has one of two file extensions,</div><div>depending on which of two data formats you choose for the virtual disk.</div><div> </div><div>.vhd: older format that has a max disk size of 2TB</div><div>.vhdx: newer format that can support virtual disks up to 64TB</div><div> </div><div>For either of these virtual disk formats, Hyper-V lets you create two different</div><div>types of virtual disks:</div><div> </div><div>1. Fixed-size disk: A virtual disk whose disk space is preallocated to the full</div><div>size of the drive when you create the disk.</div><div> </div><div>2. Dynamic expanding disk: A virtual disk that has a max disk space, but that</div><div>actually consumes only the amount of disk space that is required to hold the</div><div>data on the disk. </div><div> </div><div>Do not be confused by the names fixed size and dynamically expanding. Both types</div><div>of disk can be expanded later if you run out of space. The main difference is</div><div>whether the max amount of disk space allowed for the drive is allocated when the</div><div>drive is first created or as needed when data is added to the drive. Allocating</div><div>the space when the drive is created results in better performance for the drive,</div><div>because Hyper-V does not have to grab more disk space every time data is added</div><div>to the drive. Both types of drives can be expanded later if necessary. </div><div> </div><div><strong>Enabling Hyper-V</strong></div><div>Hyper-V is not enabled when you install Windows, you must first enable this</div><div>feature before you can use Hyper-V.</div><div> </div><div>To enable Hyper-V on a server version of Windows, call up the Server Manager and</div><div>open the Add Roles and Features Wizard. Then enable the Hyper-V role. When you</div><div>complete the Wizard, Hyper-V will install the Type-1 hypervisor and move the</div><div>existing Windows Server operating system into the parent partition. You can then</div><div>start building virtual machines.</div><div> </div><div>To enable Hyper-V on a desktop version on Windows:</div><div>1. open the control panel</div><div>2. choose programs and features</div><div>3. click 'turn Windows features on or off'</div><div>4. select the Hyper-V feature and click ok</div><div>5. when prompted, restart the computer</div><div> </div><div><strong>Managing Hyper-V</strong></div><div>To manage Hyper-V, you use the Hyper-V Manager. To start this program, click the</div><div>start button, type Hyper-V, and choose Hyper-V manager. The Hyper-V Manager</div><div>window is divided into 5 panes:</div><div>1. Navigation</div><div>2. Virtual Machines</div><div>3. Checkpoints</div><div>4. Virtual Machine Summary pane</div><div>5. Actions</div><div> </div><div><strong>Creating a Virtual Switch</strong></div><div>Before you start creating virtual machines in hyper-V, you should create a</div><div>virtual switch so that your virtual machines can communicate with each other and</div><div>with the outside world. To do that, you use the Virtual Switch manager. Here are</div><div>the steps:</div><div>1. In Hyper-V manager, click Virtual Switch manager</div><div>2. Select the type of virtual switch you want to create. An External switch is</div><div>the usual option.</div><div>3. Click create virtual switch</div><div>4. Type a name for the new virtual switch in the name field</div><div>5. Select the physical network adapter you want to bind the virtual switch to.</div><div>6. If your network has multiple vlans, click the enable virtual lan</div><div>identification management operating system check box and enter the vlan ID for</div><div>the vlan you want this switch to connect to.</div><div>7. Click Ok</div><div> </div><div><strong>Creating a Virtual Disk</strong></div><div>Before you create a virtual machine, it is best to first create a virtual disk</div><div>for the machine to use. Note that you can create a virtual disk at the same time</div><div>that you create a virtual machine. However, creating the virtual disk first</div><div>gives you more flexibility. So, i recommend you create virtual disks and virtual</div><div>machines separately. </div><div>1. In hyper-V manager, click New and choose Hard Disk</div><div>2. Click Next </div><div>3. choose .vhdx disk format</div><div>4. Select the disk type you want to use. I prefer fixed size for the performance</div><div>5. Click next</div><div>6. Specify the name and location of the new disk</div><div>7. Click next</div><div>8. Specify the max size for the disk drive</div><div>9. Click next</div><div>10. Click Finish</div><div> </div><div><strong>Creating a Virtual Machine</strong></div><div>After you have created a virtual disk, creating a virtual machine to use it is a</div><div>straight forward affair.</div><div>1. From hyper-V Manager, choose New and then choose Virtual machine</div><div>2. Click Next</div><div>3. Enter the name you want to use for your virtual machine</div><div>4. Specify the location of the virtual machine's configuration file</div><div>5. Click Next</div><div>6. Specify the generation you want to use for the new virtual machine. Use</div><div>Generation 2.</div><div>7. Click Next</div><div>8. Indicate the amount of ram you want to allocate for the new machine. Increase</div><div>it and select dynamic memory.</div><div>9. Click next</div><div>10. Select the virtual switch you want to use</div><div>11. Click Next</div><div>12. Click browse and select the virtual disk you created earlier</div><div>13.
