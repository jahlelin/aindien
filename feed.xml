                    <div>Scaling your network is the next step for most businesses. There are computer networks everywhere these days. From the business to our homes, local area networks and wireless systems are common and easy to create. What happens though when you want to connect 2 or more local area networks together? Well it gets really interesting then. Most organizations aspire to grow. When an organization or business grows they will need to connect remote offices. Connecting your lans together or just adding wireless in a wide area network is the natural evolution of scaling your infrastructure.</div>

                    <p>Cloud computing is used a lot these days. Many times people are referring to totally different concepts. When mentioning it, however, there is definitely a disconnect or a lack of understanding of what this means. I will clear some things up and give a good overview of what we are talking about when we say "cloud computing".</p>

                    <p>My Powershell for beginners guide will teach you the fundamentals of this tool in a Windows environment. It has been around a long time and has been through several versions already. Many information technology people have waited to become familiar with this tool. They did so because many were not sure it would continue to be supported in the future. Well we now know that not only has it continued to be supported but it is the preferred way by many to administer a Windows environment. So continue with me and we will discuss the basics so that you can go on and make this a long learning endeavor.</p>
