An optimizing buyer makes decisions at the margin. An individual’s demand curve reflects an ability and willingness to pay for a good or service. Consumer surplus is the difference between what a buyer is willing to pay for a good and what the buyer actually pays. Elasticity measures a variable’s responsiveness to changes in another variable.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, as a buyer, you want to buy goods and services that you like, because you prefer to buy what tastes good, sounds good, or looks good. You must also consider prices of the various goods and services that interest you. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits that you receive from consuming goods and services are a direct result of your tastes and preferences. When it comes to the buyer’s problem, economists assume that the consumer attempts to maximize the benefits from consumption. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prices are the most important incentives that economists study. They allow us to formally define the relative cost of goods. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final ingredient of the buyer’s problem is what you can buy. The budget set is the set of all possible bundles of goods and services that a consumer can purchase with his income. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An optimizing buyer makes decisions at the margin. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A decrease in the price of either good will cause the budget constraint to pivot outward. When a price changes, the opportunity cost changes. This will cause the buyer to change the optimal quantities consumed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an understanding of how to spend optimally, we can begin to construct demand curves. An individual’s willingness to pay measured over different quantities of the same good makes up the individual’s demand curve. The demand curve isolates the contribution that a good’s own price makes toward determining the quantity demanded in a given time period.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quantity demanded refers to the amount of a good that buyers are willing to purchase at a particular price. A demand curve maps how quantity demanded responds to price changes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand curve shows how the quantity demanded depends on the price of the good. The demand curve is downward sloping. Every point on your demand curve represents a unique price and quantity level. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have learned we should recognize the incentives that we face and make decisions based on marginal analysis. That is, we should consider the marginal benefits and marginal costs in our decision making. In markets, the process of optimal decision making by consumers often yields total benefits well above the price we pay for goods. Economists give these market-created benefits a name, consumer-surplus. Consumer surplus is the difference between the willingness to pay and the price paid for the good. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When price increases, consumer surplus decreases. The higher the price, the smaller the difference between the willingness to pay and the market price. Furthermore, the higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we want to know how responsive quantity demanded is to a change in price, we want to know about price elasticity. Elasticity measures the sensitivity of one economic variable to a change in another. In other words, it tells us how much one variable changes when another variable changes. More precisely, elasticity is a ratio of percentage changes in variables. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elasticity is an important concept because it takes into account not only the direction of change but also the size of the change. The different types are:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price elasticity of demand</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-price elasticity of demand</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Income elasticity of demand</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know from the law of demand that when the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded generally falls. However, we do not know how much quantity demanded falls. The price elasticity of demand measures the percentage change in quantity demanded of a good resulting from a percentage change in the good’s price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The distinction between whether a good has a price elasticity of demand greater than or less than 1 is very important. A price elasticity of 1 says that if the price is increased by 20% then quantity demanded decreases by 20%. 20/20=1. So, if price elasticity is greater than 1, price increases hurt revenue.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elasticity is much different than the slope of a line. Even though the slope is the same over the entire demand curve, the elasticity varies over the slope of the line. This is because the ratio of price to quantity changes as we move along the demand curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, elasticities tend to vary over ranges of the demand curve. They are different at the top, middle, and bottom of the curve. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another measure that economists often calculate is arc elasticity. The arc elasticity achieves a stable elasticity regardless of the starting point by using the average price and quantity in the calculation. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goods with a price elasticity of demand greater than 1 have elastic demand. The percentage change in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage change in price. Peanut butter is an example.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goods with a price elasticity of demand equal to 1 have unit elastic demand. 1 percent price change affects quantity demanded by 1 percent. So, in this example, a price increase does not affect revenue. Wine is a good with this characteristic. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goods with a price elasticity of demand less than 1 have inelastic demand. When the price elasticity of demand is less than 1, the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price. Cigarettes are such a good. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand can also be perfectly inelastic, which means that quantity demanded is completely unaffected by price. An example of this is insulin, you just have to have it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists have pinpointed three primary reasons for elasticity differences:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Closeness of substitutes</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget share spent on the good</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Available time to adjust</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists are interested in much more than merely how changes in a good’s price affect consumers. Another type of inelasticity that economists consider is how quantity demanded for one good changes when the price of a substitute or complement good changes. This is called the cross-price elasticity of demand. It is a measurement of the percentage change in quantity demanded of a good due to a percentage change in another good’s price. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a cross-price elasticity is negative, then the two goods are complements. Two goods are complements when the fall in the price of one leads to a right shift in the demand curve for another. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a cross-price elasticity is positive, then the two goods are substitutes. Two goods are substitutes when the rise in the price of one leads to a right shift in the demand curve for the other. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A third type of elasticity measurement has to do with how changes in income affect consumption patterns. The income elasticity of demand informs us of the percentage change in quantity demanded of a good due to a percentage change in the consumer’s income. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good is normal if the quantity demanded is directly related to income. When income rises, consumers buy more of a normal good.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good is inferior if the quantity demanded is inversely related to income. When income rises, consumers buy less of an inferior good. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which of the following are necessary ingredients to the buyer’s problem?</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prices of goods and services</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amount of money the consumer has to spend</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers tastes and preferences</span></li></ol><p><br><br><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akio consumes two goods, books and video games. His income is $40, the price of a video game is $8 and the price of a book is $4.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose Akio’s parents give him $24 for his birthday. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use his income, the monetary gift from his parents, and the price data to find the maximum amounts of each good that he could purchase. These will give you the endpoints of the budget constraint, from which you can sketch the budget set. </span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8 video games</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">16 books</span></li></ol><p><br><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now suppose Akio’s parents had given him three video games for his birthday instead of giving him $24. Akio is a very polite young man and would never return a gift that his parents had given him for cash.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The budget constraint is simply a subset of the budget set; graphically, it is the outer edge of the budget set that separates affordable bundles from unaffordable bundles. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on your preceding answers, which of the following applies:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could be indifferent between a gift of $24 and a gift of three video games.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akio could prefer a gift of three video games.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanna has $420 to spend on movies and concerts.

Suppose he is currently buying these products in amounts such that his marginal benefit from an additional soft drink is $180 and his marginal benefit from an additional slice of pizza is $80. If the price of a soft drink is $4 and the price of a slice of pizza is $3, is Charley maximizing his total benefits?</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, he should shift consumption toward soft drinks and away from pizza to maximize his total benefits.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand curve shows:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How the quantity demanded responds to changes in the price of the good</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything else the same, as the price of the good increases, quantity demanded:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decreases</span></li></ol><p><br><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to economists, the process of optimal decision making by consumers typically yields total benefits well above the amount paid for the goods. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These market-created benefits are referred to as:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer surplus</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the graph to the right, they are represented by area:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">B</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose now that the market price falls.
