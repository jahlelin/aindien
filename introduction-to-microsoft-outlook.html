You can have your work email, of course, but also connect your personal email and calendars too. You can organize everything with different folders and filters. There is a smart assistant to help you write emails. You can share files with OneDrive to make it even easier.</p><p> </p><p>The calendar will organize your day. You can see as many as you need or add your own. The calendar will show your meetings and help you plan your next one.</p><p> </p><p>To add an email account select File then Add Account. Enter your email address then select continue. Enter your password if prompted then hit OK. Hit Finish to complete the setup process.</p><p> </p><p>Creating and sending email is easy. Choose New mail to start a message. Enter a name or email address in the To field. In the Subject line type what the email is about. Put the cursor in the body of the email and start typing. After you are done, you hit Send. Use @Name to get someone's attention.</p><p> </p><p>You can manage your calendar in Outlook. To schedule an appointment, choose New Appointment. Then add a Subject, Location, and start/end times. Select Invite Attendees to turn the appointment into a meeting. Select Save &amp; Close to finish or hit Send if it has turned into a meeting.</p><p> </p><p>When you create a meeting, use the Scheduling Assistant to see when attendees and rooms are available. From a new meeting request, select Scheduling Assistant. The shaded area with vertical bars shows the meeting time. Drag the bars to adjust the meeting time. The grid shows when attendees are available. To the right of the meeting request, Outlook shows suggested times and the number of conflicts.</p><p> </p><p>To add a contact, select the People icon. Select New Contact. Enter a name and any other information that you want to include for the contact. Select Save &amp; New to create another contact, or Save &amp; Close if you are done.</p><p> </p><p>Collaboration is easily done in outlook. To share a file or collaborate on attachments, select Attach File and choose a file. If the file has a small cloud icon, it is already saved to the cloud, which lets you share and work on it with others. If it does not, click the drop-down arrow, hover on Upload, and then select OneDrive. Type a message and select Send.</p><p> </p><p>You can also set up online meetings and share the notes. In the left pane, select the Calendar icon. To set up a meeting, attendees can join remotely, select New Teams Meeting. This inserts a link remote attendees can use to join the meeting. To set up a shared space for notes, select Meeting Notes. You can create a new OneNote notebook, or select an existing notebook. A link to the notebook appears in the meeting request.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Setup Auto-Reply for Out of Office</strong></p><p>Microsoft 365 subscribers can set up automatic replies for when they are out of office or unavailable to respond to email.</p><ul><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ul><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ol type="1"><li value="1">Select File…Automatic Replies</li><li>Select Send automatic replies</li><li>If you do not want the messages to go out right away, select Only send during this time range</li><li>Choose the dates and times you would like to set your automatic reply for</li><li>Type in a message.

A contact list is a collection of email addresses, and is useful for sending emails to a group of people. Contact lists are sometimes referred to as distribution lists.</p><p> </p><p>For example, create a contact list and add all the members of any certain group to it. When you want to send an email message to everyone in this group, just enter the name of the group in the To line of the email.</p><p> </p><p>By default, contact lists are created in the default Contacts folder, and you can also see them under Your Contact Lists. If you want to save the contact list in a different folder, select the folder before you select New Contact List.</p><p> </p><p>Groups are something similar in Outlook. Create a group to give your team a space for conversations, shared files, scheduling events, and more. To create a new group:</p><ul><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ul><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ol type="1"><li value="1">On the People page, on the toolbar, select the arrow next to New Contact, and then select New Group.</li><li>Enter a name for the group, and add your information.</li><li>Select Create</li></ol></li></ul></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Transfer Contacts Between Outlook and Gmail</strong></p><p>You can use the same contacts in both Google Gmail and Outlook, without adding them manually to both locations.</p><ul><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ul><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ol type="1"><li value="1">Log on to google contacts</li><li>In the left column, click More</li><li>At the top left, click More</li><li>Click Export</li><li>Under Which contacts do you want to export, click a contact group or All Contacts</li><li>Under which export format, click Outlook CSV</li><li>Click Export</li><li>When prompted to download the export file, click Save</li><li>Choose a location on your computer to temporarily save the file.

Before you export contacts from Outlook, it is helpful to understand the difference between the Outlook Address Book and Outlook Contacts. Both are part of Outlook. However, the Address book is a compilation of the different address lists that you might store in Outlook, such as LDAP internet directories, the global address list, or other third party address books. Contacts is only one of the address lists included in an Address Book. Only contacts can be exported directly from outlook to Google Gmail.</p><ul><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ul><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ol type="1"><li value="1">Click the File Tab</li><li>Click Options</li><li>Click Advanced</li><li>Under Export, click Export</li><li>In the Import and Export Wizard, click Export to a file, and then click Next</li><li>Click Comma Separated Value and then click Next</li><li>In the folder list, click the contacts folder you want to export, and then click Next.</li><li>Choose a location on your computer to temporarily save the file.

You will notice as you clean up your different files, the size of your mailbox will decrease when you delete and archive items.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1j37n9aag41"><strong>Changing the View of Outlook Items</strong></h2><div class="adn ads" data-message-id="#msg-a:r4461119148399633746" data-legacy-message-id="198ce9cc00dd28ac"><div class="gs"><div><div id=":mv" class="ii gt"><div id=":mu" class="a3s aiL"><div dir="ltr"><p>In Outlook, it is possible to change or customize the view of your messages, tasks, contacts and calendar items. Discover how to change the display of Outlook items by changing the font size or style. With the Outlook application open, you can use the view settings to give yourself different ways to visualize items in an area of Outlook. Each area, such as mail or Calendar, allows you to customize your view and change the organization of the items, fonts, and many other settings as well. For example, if I wanted to change the font settings in mail, I am going to click on the View tab, and in the View tab go to the Current View group and click on the View Settings tool. This will open the Advanced View Settings window. You have different options here, for example you could change different settings such as Columns, Group By, Sort, Filter, etc… and Other Settings.</p><p> </p><p>I am going to click on this option to open the Other Settings window. From here, I am going to go to the Message preview option and click on the font button. This will open the Font window. You can change the font by using the scroll bar to scroll through the different options and click on the font that you want to use. You can also apply a style by clicking on Regular, Italic, Bold, or Bold Italic, and you can also change the size by again scrolling through and clicking on the size that you want to use. You can see a sample of your settings before saving them, and to save click on the Ok button, and then click on the Ok button in the Other Settings window, and then in the Advanced View Settings compact window.</p><p> </p><p>Having done so, I can now see the font has changed in the email preview in my email list. I am now going to go to Tasks by clicking on the Tasks icon. Now in Tasks, if I wanted to modify the view, I am going to click again on the View tab and click on the view Settings tool, and in the Advanced View Settings window I am going to click on Other settings. In the Other Settings window in Tasks, I am going to change the position of the reading pane. For example, you have the option right, Bottom, or Off. I am going to click on the radio button next to Bottom and then click on the ok button to save, and click on Ok in the Advanced View Settings window.</p><p> </p><p>Having clicked Ok, the change now appears and I can see the view change in the interface. You can also change the view of your calendars by clicking on the Calendar icon. When Calendar opens, click on the view tab and then the View Settings tool. In the Advanced View Settings Calendar window, click on Other Settings. From here, you can change the time scale option, for example. 30 minutes is selected, but if I click on the dropdown menu, a menu opens where I can choose between 5,6,10,15,30, and 60 minutes. I am going to click on 15 and click on Ok to save, and click on Ok in the Advanced View Settings window as well. I can see the view change has been applied to the Calendar interface.</p><p> </p><p>If you want to change the view for your contacts, click on the People icon. When the interface opens, click on the View tab and the View Settings tool. In the Advanced View Settings window for people, there are two options available: Sort and Filter. I am going to click on sort. The Sort window has opened and you can change how your contacts are organized. For example, File As is selected in an Ascending order, but if I click on the dropdown menu button I can click on another option from the menu, such as full name, and then click on the radio button next to Descending, and click on ok to save, and then click on Ok in the Advanced Settings window. I can see that the view of my contacts has been modified.</p><p> </p><p>If when making changes to the views of the different areas of Outlook you decide that you want to go back to the default mode, you can reset the settings in the same way for all four areas. For example, I am going to demonstrate this by going back to mail and clicking on the Mail icon, clicking on the View tab, and in the current View group, I am going to click on the Reset View tool. A dialog box will open asking if you are sure you want to reset the view to its original settings, and to confirm click on the yes button. The dialog box will close and you will see the default settings will reappear in the interface.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 22, 2025</p><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fintroduction-to-microsoft-outlook.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fintroduction-to-microsoft-outlook.html&amp;via=_Aindien&amp;text=Introduction%20to%20Microsoft%20Outlook" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://aindien.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://aindien.com/introduction-to-microsoft-teams.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Introduction to Microsoft Teams</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://aindien.com/introduction-to-microsoft-onedrive.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Introduction to Microsoft OneDrive </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-07-22T21:39" class="feed__date">July 22, 2025</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/introduction-to-excel.html" class="invert">Introduction to Excel</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-07-07T20:31" class="feed__date">July 7, 2025</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/introduction-to-microsoft-onedrive.html" class="invert">Introduction to Microsoft OneDrive</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-06-29T20:38" class="feed__date">June 29, 2025</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/introduction-to-microsoft-teams.html" class="invert">Introduction to Microsoft Teams</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><style type="text/css">#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }
