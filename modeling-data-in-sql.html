There are rules to follow and each database vendor has a slightly<br>different outlook on how you should do things. These different rules affect how<br>you model the data you want to work with. <br><br>Data modeling is the first task you need to tackle. It is the process of putting<br>your ideas into rows, columns, and relations. There are three types of data<br>modeling. They are physical, logical, and conceptual. Each layer refers to a<br>degree of elaboration ending with a model that can be translated into sql<br>statements and implemented into your database system fo chocie. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Conceptual Modeling</strong></span><br>Conceptual modeling deals with the highest level of abstractions such as<br>entities and relationships. Entities refer to the actual physical objects or<br>abstract concepts in your requirements. If you are modeling dats for a library,<br>you might think of books, authors, borrowers, and librarians. If you are<br>creating a data model for a bank, your entities would be accounts, clients,<br>and money. Relationships model the way these entities interact. Relationships<br>are defined through primary and foreign keys.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Logical Modeling</strong></span><br>This is the next step in data modeling. Here you begin by thinking of<br>attributes. The trick is to distinguish between attributes that you want to<br>track as opposed to those that do not matter. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Physical Modeling</strong></span><br>Physical modeling is the final stage. This is where your abstract ideas become<br>something real. You are getting ready to translate your ideas into scripts and<br>implement them in an actual database system. This is the stage where you define<br>the names of your tables, names for columns, and most importantly, your data<br>types. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Data Types</strong></span><br>Database systems were created to store information. Data types help to tune<br>database performance. For example, xml data can be represented as text. It is<br>text but text processing is not optimized for the structured nature of xml<br>documents. With the exception of desktop database systems, every single database<br>system vendor decided to implement a specific xml data type to address the<br>issue. <br><br>Another reason for data types' existence is their role in enforcing domain<br>integrity. This refers to the ability of a specific data type to enforce<br>constraints. For example, with a "date" data type, it might be possible to enter<br>a date that also meant something else. Before we can enter the data into our<br>relational database, we have to break the data into pieces of specific data<br>types such as characters, numbers, and pictures. This information is<br>reconstituted by a client application later on.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Character Data</strong></span><br>All character strings in sql can be of fixed length or varying length. A<br>character string can be defined as a sequence of characters that belong to a<br>predefined character set. A character set is the language your database stores.<br>You might remember specifying collation order or locale during your database<br>system setup process. The length of the string is the number of characters in<br>the sequence. This is where internal representation matters. A character can be<br>represented by one or more bytes with latin-based languages. Everyone else in<br>the world, just about, cannot.<br><br>A byte is a computetr term for a unit of information storage that consists of 8<br>bits. Each bit can be either 1 or 0. The combination of 8 bits allows us to<br>store 256 distinct values, which form the foundation of ASCII character sets.<br>While there were attempts to remedy the situation with extended code pages,<br>ultimately the solution came with the introduction of Unicode. It is a standard<br>doub;e byte character set that assigns a unique number to every single<br>character, so it can represent many more characters than ASCII. The Unicode<br>standard is the result of development coordinated by a nonprofit organizaiton<br>called the Unicode consortium. <br><br>Sql thinks in characters but computers count bits and bytes. If you define a<br>string to be of fixed length, the system allocates a certain number of bytes in<br>memory or on a computer hard disk. If your character set is latin based, a total<br>of 10 bytes will be allocated for the string, but if you use a double byte<br>character set, such as chinese, 20 bytes will have to be allocated. It does not<br>matter whether the actual value to be stored in that string is exactly that many<br>bytes or not, it will occupy the whole space that is allocated to it. So, all<br>string will have exactly the same length.<br><br>If you define a string variable as a varying length string with a maximum of 10<br>characters to store, the behavior will be different. The actual memory or disk<br>space required to hold the value will be allocated dynamically as needed. Only<br>strings that are 10 characters long will have all 10 characters allocated to<br>them, but if you have a string that is only 2 characters, only 2 bytes of<br>storage will be allocated. <br><br>As you can imagine, this flexibility comes with a performance hit because the<br>database system must perform the additional task of dynamic allocations. A<br>standard piece of advice when you need to squeeze the last drop of performance<br>out of the database is to profile your data and allocated fixed length strings<br>for values that always come in predefined lengths. Just don't forget to have<br>checks in place for your inserts. An attempt to insert 11 characters into a<br>field defined as char(10) would result in an error. Also, when comparing two<br>character strings, variable length strings would not care much about trailing<br>blanks but fixed length strings would.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Binary Strings</strong></span><br>A binary string is a sequence of bytes in the same way that a character string<br>is a sequence of characters, but unlike character strings that usually contain<br>information in the form of text, a binary string is used to hold nontraditional<br>data such as images, audio, and video files. Binary strings can be used for<br>purposes similar to those of character strings, but the two data types are not<br>compatible. The difference is like text and a photo of the same text. <br><br>It might be a little confusing to learn that plain text documents can be stored<br>as character strings and a Word document has to be treated as a binary string. A<br>Word or Pdf file is a text document from a user's point of view, but from a<br>computer storage perspective, it is not. In addition to plain text characters,<br>it contains many special markers and instructions that only those programs can<br>interpret. The same is true for any other special files such as bitmaps.<br>spreadsheets, audio files, and video files. <br><br>Because a Pdf is a binary file, it also contains information about fonts,<br>positioning, coloring, and other formatting. This information is a set of<br>instructions that the host program understands and can interpret to display<br>human readable text and any other objects that might be embedded into the<br>document.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Numeric Data</strong></span><br>After the characters come numbers. Exact numbers can either be whole integers or<br>have decimal points. Numbers can be positive and negative. They can have<br>precision and scale. Precision determines the maximum total number of decimal<br>digits that can be stored. Scale specifies the maximum number of decimals<br>allowed. <br><br>Approximate numbers are numbers that cannot be represented with absolute<br>precision. Each numeric data type has limits, a range of values that it can<br>represent which is pretty consistent across systems. The value ranges for some<br>common numeric data types. <br><br>Most of the time, numbers are hidden in the database. Once in a while, you might<br>need to use numbers as a value inserted into your query, and databases can be<br>very particular in what format you supply them. Literals for numbers are<br>represented as strings, optionally preceded by plus or minus signs, with an<br>optional decimal part for numeric or decimal data types separated by a dot.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Time Data Types</strong></span><br>Handling dates and time is probably one of the most confusing and inconsistent<br>topics in sql. Partly them comes from the inconsistency of the human devised<br>system of tracking days and times. The date data type behaves differently from<br>implementation to implementation. Some system have separate keywords and others<br>comebine date and times into one keyword for queries. <br><br>The dates and times get into the database as literals as a return result from a<br>function or as a conversion. The database systems have implemented a number of<br>sql functions to help handle this peculiar data type. While it might be apparent<br>to humans that some literal strings are veritable dates, computers have no such<br>insight and try to treat anything as a date. Once dates are in the database, you<br>need to take extra care manipulating them. For example, if you compare two dates<br>that have the same day, month, and year component but differ in time they will<br>be evaluated as not equal. Be sure to compare apples to apples. There are many<br>date and time related functions to help you compare values, extract information,<br>and even do date arithmetic.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Binaery Data</strong></span><br>Binary data are for computers to understand and interpret so that humans can<br>understand. Prime examples of binary data are pictures and only your image<br>editor knows how to arrange these ones and zeros into a picture. There is not<br>much you can do with binary data in sql besides storing it and retrieving it on<br>demand. To store binary data, database systems have introduced a number of<br>binary data types.<br><br></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 24, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://aindien.com/sql/">SQL</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fmodeling-data-in-sql.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fmodeling-data-in-sql.html&amp;via=_Aindien&amp;text=Modeling%20Data%20in%20SQL" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://aindien.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://aindien.com/worksheet-data-in-excel.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Worksheet Data in Excel</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://aindien.com/sharing-your-home-network.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Sharing Your Home Network </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-08-18T16:19" class="feed__date">August 18, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/worksheet-data-in-excel.html" class="invert">Worksheet Data in Excel</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-04-22T23:22" class="feed__date">April 22, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/using-data-and-models-in-economics.html" class="invert">Using Data and Models in Economics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-06-30T09:10" class="feed__date">June 30, 2017</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/how-to-read-data-from-a-file-with-c.html" class="invert">How To Read Data From A File With C++</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><style type="text/css">#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }
