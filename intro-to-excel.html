It is part of the<br>Microsoft Office suite. Excel is used to perform numerical calculations. We use<br>Excel for number crunching, creating charts, organizing lists, text<br>manipulation, and accessing other data. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Understanding Workbooks and Worksheets</strong></span><br>Your work is done in a workbook. You can have many workbooks open at once. They<br>use an .xlsx extension. Workbooks will each open in a different window. <br><br>Each workbook contains one or more worksheets. Each worksheet is made up of<br>individual cells. Each cell can contain a value, a formula, or text. A<br>worksheet can also contain charts, images, and diagrams. Worksheets are<br>available by clicking a tab at the bottom of the workbook. <br><br>Every worksheet contains rows starting with the number 1. Columns start with the<br>letter "A". The intersection of a row and column is a single cell. Each cell has<br>a unique address made up of its column letter and row number. At any given time,<br>one cell is the active cell. It is the cell you have highlighted and it accepts<br>keyboard input. Its contents can be edited. You can identify the active cell by<br>its darker border. <br><br>The Ribbon has various functions and tabs built in. We will cover them as they<br>come up. You can access the Ribbon by using keyboard commands just as easy as<br>the mouse. Use the "alt" key to display shortcuts on the Ribbon. Once you have<br>used the keys a few times you will start remembering some of them. This is how<br>you improve your workflow. <br><br>Sometimes you will want to repeat a command. If you apply some particular<br>formatting to a cell then you can press ctrl-y to repeat it. <br><br>There are also shorcut menus everywhere. You can right click just about anything<br>and get access to another menu. These menus are just another way to accomplish<br>certain tasks. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Creating A Workbook</strong></span><br>Start Excel with an empty workbook. If you have one open already you can create<br>a new one with the ctrl-n command. <br><br>If you enter in a column of numbers work on as data, you can format them to make<br>them easier to read and understand. You can select all the cells in a range by<br>dragging with your mouse from beginning to the end. In the Number group on the<br>Ribbon, click the drop down Number Format and select currency or any other data<br>type you might be using. If currency, make sure and choose the two decimal place<br>too. <br><br>We can now create a table with this data. Click on any cell that includes your<br>data. </p><ul><li>    Choose insert  </li><li>    Tables</li><li>    Table</li></ul><p> <br>Excel displays the create table box so youcan peruse the settings. Click ok and you get another tab to look at. You can choose different table types. <br><br>Now, we can sum the data. </p><ul><li>    Activate any cell in the table</li><li>    Choose table tools</li><li>    Design</li><li>    Table Style Options</li><li>    Total Row</li></ul><p> </p><p>Excel automatically adds a new row to the bottom of your table. including a<br>formula that calculates the total of your data. If you would prefer to see a<br>different summary formula you can choose a different summary formula from the<br>drop down list. <br><br>We can create a chart using a similar process. </p><ul><li>    Activate any cell in the table</li><li>    Choose insert</li><li>    Charts</li><li>    Recommended Charts<br>   </li></ul><p>Select one of the options you see. You might even experiment and try a few<br>to see what you like for your data. Excel will insert the chart into the<br>center of your window. You can move it by dragging it in one direction. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Printing Your Worksheet</strong></span><br>Printing is easy if you have a printer available to you. </p><ul><li>    Click on any cell</li><li>    Click Page Layout to make sure everything looks good</li><li>    Choose File then Print</li></ul><p>    Finally, click the Print button at the top<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Saving Your Workbook</strong></span><br>You will want to save your work so you do not lose it. </p><ul><li>    Click the Save button on the quick access bar</li><li>    It asks you to choose a location and name for your new file</li><li>    Click Browse to select the location</li><li>    In the File Name field, name it something that makes sense to you</li><li>    Click Save once more to have your file saved</li></ul><p><br>By default, Excel saves a copy of your work every few min, but you should save<br>anyway to be sure you do not lose anything. <br><br></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1i5jm32v86" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Worksheet Data in Excel</strong></span></h2><p><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Intro</strong></span><br>A worksheet has around 17 billion cells. A cell can be a numeric value, text, or<br>a formula. A worksheet can hold charts, diagrams, pictures, buttons, and other<br>things. <br><br>Numeric values represent a quantity of some type. They can also be dates or<br>times. Excel can display values in many different formats too. <br><br>Most worksheets include text in some of the cells. Text can serve as data,<br>labels, headings, or some type of instruction. It is often used to clarify what<br>the values in a worksheet mean or where the numbers came from. Text that begins<br>with a number is still considered text.<br><br>Formulas are what make a spreadsheet a spreadsheet. Excel enables you to enter<br>flexible formulas that use the values in cells to calculate a result. When you<br>enter a formula into a cell, the formula's result appears in the cell. If you<br>change any of the cells used by a formula, the formula recalculates and shows<br>the new result. <br><br>They can be simple mathematical expresisons or they can use functions that are<br>built in to Excel. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Entering Values</strong></span><br>To enter a numeric value into a cell, move the cell pointer to the appropriate<br>cell, type the value, and press enter or one of the arrow keys. The value is<br>displayed in the cell and appears in the formula bar when the cell is selected.<br>You can include decimal points and currency symbols when entering values, along<br>with plus signs, minus signs, and commas. If you precede a value with a minus<br>sign or enclose it in parentheses, Excel considers it to be a negative number.<br><br>Entering text into a cell is just as easy as entering a value. Activate the<br>cell, type the text, then press enter or an arrow key. A cell can contain a<br>maximum of around 32000 characters. Even though a cell can hold a huge number of<br>characters, you can't actually display all of them.<br><br>If you type a long text entry into a cell, the formula bar may not show all of<br>the text. To display more of the text in the formula bar, click the bottom of<br>the formula bar and drag down to increase the height. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Entering Dates and Times</strong></span><br>Excel treats dates and times as special types of numeric values. Dates and time<br>are values that are formatted so that they appear as dates and times. If you<br>work with dates and times, you need to understand Excel's date and time system.<br><br>Excel handles dates by using a serial number system. The earliest date that<br>Excel understands is January 1, 1900. This date has a serial number of 1 and so<br>on. This system makes it easy to deal with dates in formulas. For example, you<br>can enter a formula to calculate the number of days between two dates.<br><br>Most of the time, you do not have to be concerned with the serial number date<br>system. You can simply enter a date in a common date format and Excel will take<br>care of the details. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Entering Time Values</strong></span><br>When you work with times, you extend Excel's date serial number system to<br>include decimals. In other words, Excel works with times by using fractional<br>days. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Modifying Cells</strong></span><br>After you enter a value or text into a cell, you can modify it in several ways.<br>Delete the cell's contents, replace the cell's contents with something else, or<br>edit the cell's contents. You can also modify a cell by changing its formatting.<br>However, formatting a cell only affects a cell's appearance, it does not affect<br>the cell's contents. <br><br>To delete the contents of a cell, just click the cell and press the delete key.<br>To delete more than one cell, select all of the cells that you want to delete<br>and then press enter. Pressing delete removes the cell's contents but does not<br>remove any formatting that you may have applied to the cell.<br><br>For more control over what gets deleted, you can choose home, editing, then<br>clear. This drop down list contains:<br>1. Clear All<br>2. Clear Formats<br>3. Clear Contents<br>4. Clear Comments<br>5. Clear Hyperlinks<br>6. Remove Hyperlinks<br>Clearing formats doesn't clear the background colors in a range that has been<br>designated as a table unless you have replaced the table style background colors<br>manually.<br><br>To replace the contents of a cell with something else, just activate the cell<br>and type your new entry, which replaces the previous contents. Any formatting<br>applied to the cell remains in place and is applied to the new content.<br><br>You can also replace cell contents by dragging and dropping or by pasting data<br>from the Clipboard. In both cases, the cell formatting will be replaced by the<br>format of the new data. To avoid pasting formatting, choose:<br>home <br>clipboard<br>paste <br>values<br><br>If the cell contains only a few characters, replacing its contents by typing new<br>data usually is easiest. However, if the cell contains lengthy text or a complex<br>formula and you need to make only a slight modification, you probably want to<br>edit the cell rather than re-enter information.<br><br>When you want to edit the contents of a cell, you can use one of the following<br>ways to enter cell-edit mode.<br>Double click the cell<br>Select the cell and press F2<br>Select the cell then click inside formula bar<br><br>All these methods cause Excel to go into edit mode. When Excel is in edit mode,<br>the formula bar enables two icons: the X and Check mark. When you begin editing<br>a cell, the insertion point appears as a vertical bar, and you can perform the<br>following tasks:<br>1. Add new characters at the location of the insertion point<br>2. Select multiple characters<br>3. Select characters while you are editing a cell<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Data Entry Techniques</strong></span><br>You can simplify the process of entering information into your Excel worksheets<br>and make your work go quite a bit faster by using a number of tricks. By<br>default, Excel automatically moves the cell pointer to the next cell down when<br>you press the enter key after entering data into a cell. To change this setting:<br>File<br>Options<br>Advanced Tab<br>The check box that controls this behavior is labled after pressing enter, Move<br>Selection. If you enable this option, you can choose the direction in which the<br>cell pointer moves.<br><br>Instead of pressing the enter key when you are finished making a cell entry, you<br>can use any of the navigation keys to complete the entry.<br><br>When a range of cells is selected, Excel automatically moves the cell pointer to<br>the next cell in the range when you press enter. If the selection consists of<br>multiple rows, Excel moves down the column. When it reaches the end of the<br>selection in the column, it moves to the cell outside the range. To skip a cell,<br>just press enter without entering anything. To go backward, press shift+enter.<br>If you prefer to enter the datas by rows rather than by columns, press tab<br>rather than enter. Excel continues to cycle through the selected range until you<br>select a cell outside the range. <br><br>If you need to enter the same data into multiple cells, select all the cells<br>that you want to contain the data, enter the value, and press control+enter. The<br>same information is inserted into each cell in the selection.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Decimal Places</strong></span><br>If you need to enter lots of numbers with a fixed number of decimal places,<br>Excel has a useful tool. Access the Excel Options dialog box and click the<br>Advanced tab. Select the automatically insert a decimal point check box and make<br>sure that the places box is set for the correct number of decimal places for the<br>data you need to enter.<br><br>When this option is set, Excel supplies the decimal points for you<br>automatically. To restore things back to normal, just clear the automatically<br>insert a decimal point box. Changing this setting does not affect any values<br>that you already entered. The fixed decimal places option is a global setting<br>and applies to all workbooks. If you forget that this option is turne don, you<br>can easily end up entering incorrect values. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Autofill</strong></span><br>The Excel autofill feature makes inserting a series of values or text items in a<br>range of cells easy. It uses the autofill handle. You can drag the autofill<br>handle to copy the cell or automatically complete a series. If you drag the<br>autofill handle while you press and hold the right mouse button, Excel displays<br>a shorcut menu with additional fill options.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Autocomplete</strong></span><br>The Excel autocomplete feature makes entering the same text into multiple cells<br>easy. With autocomplete, you type the first few letters of a text entry into a<br>cell, and Excel automatically completes the entry based on other entries that<br>you already made in the column. Besides reducing typing, this feature ensures<br>that your entries are spelled correctly and are consistent.<br><br>Autocomplete also changes the case of letters for you automatically. If you<br>start entering widgets in the second entry, Excel makes the w uppercase to be<br>consistent with the previous entry in the column. You can also access a mouse<br>oriented version of autocomplete by right clicking the cell and choosing Pick<br>From. <br><br>Keep in mind that autocomplete only works within a contiguous column of cells.<br>If you have a blank row, for example, autocomplete identifies only the cell<br>contents below the blank row. If you find the autocomplete feature distracting,<br>you can turn it off by using the advanced tab of the Excel options dialog box.<br>Remove the check box labeled enable autocomplete for cell values.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Long Text</strong></span><br>If you have lengthy text in a cell, you can force Excel to display it in<br>multiple lines within the cell; press alt+enter to start a new line in the cell.<br>When you add a line break, Excel automatically changes the cell's format to wrap<br>text. But unlike normal text wrap, your manual line break forces Excel to break<br>the text at a specific place within the text, which gives you more precise<br>control over the appearance of the text than if you rely on automatic text<br>wrapping.<br><br>To remove a manual line break, edit the cell and press delete when the insertion<br>point is located at the end of the line that contains the manual line break. You<br>will not see any symbol to indicate the position of the manual line breal, but<br>the text that follows it will move up when the line break is deleted.<br><br>You can use the autocorrect feature to create shortcuts for commonly used words<br>or phrases. Excel includes quite a few built in autocorrect terms and you can<br>add your own. To set up your custom autocorrect entries, access the Excel dialog<br>options box and click the proffing tab. Then click the autocorrect options<br>button to display the autocorrect dialog box. In the dialog box, click the<br>autocorrect tab, check the option labeled replace text as you type, and then<br>enter your custom entries. You can set up as many custom entries as you like.<br>Just be careful not to use an abbreviation that might appear normally in your<br>text.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Fractions</strong></span><br>Most of the time, you will want noninterger values to be displayed with decimal<br>points. But Excel can also display values with fractions. To enter a fractional<br>value into a cell, leave a space between the whole number and the fraction. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Forms</strong></span><br>Many people use Excel to manage lists in which the information is arranged in<br>rows. Excel offers a simple way to work with this type of data through the use<br>of a data entry form that Excel can create automatically. This data form works<br>with either a normal range of data or with a range that has been designated as a<br>table.<br><br>Unfortunately, the command to access the data form is not on the ribbon. To use<br>the data form, you must add it to your quick access toolbar or add it to the<br>ribbon. Here is how to add it to the quick access toolbar:<br>1. Right click the quick access toolbar and choose customize quick access<br>2. In the choose commands from drop down list, choose commands not in the<br>ribbon <br>3. In the list box on the left, select form<br>4. Click the add button to add the selected command to your quick access toolbar<br>5. Clicvk ok to close the Excel options dialog box<br><br>To use a data entry form:<br>1. Arrange your data so that Excel can recognize it as a table by entering<br>headings for the columns into the first row of your data entry range.<br>2. Select any cell in the table and click the form button on your quick access<br>3. Fill in the information<br>4. When you complete the data form, click the new button.<br><br>When you use either of these shortcuts to enter a date or time into your<br>worksheet, Excel enters a static value into the worksheet.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Number Formatting</strong></span><br>Number formatting refers to the process of changing the appearance of values<br>contained in cells. Excel provides a variety of number formatting options. The<br>formatting that you apply works with the selected cell or cells. Therefore, you<br>need to select the call before applying the formatting. Also remember that<br>changing the number format does not affect the underlying value. Number<br>formatting affects only the appearance.<br><br>Values that you enter into cells manually are unformatted. In other words, they<br>simply consist of a string of numerals. Typically, you want to format the<br>numbers so that they are easy to read or are more consistent in terms of the<br>number of decimal places shown.  <br><br>If you move the cell pointer to a cell that has a formatted value, the formula<br>bar displays the value in its unformatted state because the formatting affects<br>only the way the value appears in the cell. There are a few exceptions. When you<br>enter a date or a time, Excel always displays the value as a date or time, even<br>though it is stored internally as a value. Also, values that use the percentage<br>format display with a percent sign in the formula bar.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Automatic Number Formatting</strong></span><br>Excel is able to perform some formatting for you automatically. For example, if<br>you enter 12.2% into a cell, Excel knows that you wanty to use a percentage<br>format and applies it for automatically. If you use commas to separate<br>thousands, Excel applies comma formatting for you. And if you precede your value<br>with a dollar sign, the cell is formatted for currency. <br><br>A handy default feature in Excel makes entering percentage values into cells<br>easier. If a cell is formatted to display as a percent, you can simply enter a<br>normal value. To enter values less than 1%, precede the value with a zero. If<br>this automatic percent entry feature is not working, access the Excel options<br>dialog box and click the advanced tab. In the editing options section, locate<br>the enable automatic percent entry check box and add or remove the check box. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Formatting Numbers Using the Ribbon</strong></span><br>The Home&gt;Number group in the ribbon contains controls that let you qikcly apply<br>common number formats. The number format drop down list contains 11 common<br>number formats. Additional options in the home?number group include an<br>accounting number format drop down list, percent style button, and a comma style<br>button. The group also contains a button to increase the number of decimal<br>places and another to decrease the number of decimal places. <br><br>When you select one of these controls, the active cell takes on the specified<br>number format. You can also select a range of cell before clicking these<br>buttons. If you select more than one cell, Excel applies the number format to<br>all the number cells. </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 16, 2025</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://aindien.com/excel/">Excel</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fintro-to-excel.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fintro-to-excel.html&amp;via=_Aindien&amp;text=Excel%20Explained" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://aindien.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://aindien.com/services-for-cloud-computing.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Services For Cloud Computing</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://aindien.com/intro-to-networking.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Intro To Networking </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-07-22T21:39" class="feed__date">July 22, 2025</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/introduction-to-excel.html" class="invert">Introduction to Excel</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-08-18T16:19" class="feed__date">August 18, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/worksheet-data-in-excel.html" class="invert">Worksheet Data in Excel</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-08-29T23:40" class="feed__date">August 29, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/r-essentials.html" class="invert">R Programming Explained</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><style type="text/css">#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }
