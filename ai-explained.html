As a technologist or anyone working in any kind of industry, even if you are not directly coding up any of these algorithms or deploying any of these models, it is important that you understand what exactly these terms are and how they can be harnessed for the benefit, for your organization, and for your career. This learning path is for anyone who has a general curiosity about AI and ML, but absolutely no background in any of these technologies.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What is Artificial Intelligence</strong></p><p>I will start from the basics and walk you through a high level, intuitive understanding of how these algorithms and models work. The objective is by the time you are done you should be able to have meaningful conversations with the data scientists and technologists in your company that are actually working with AI and ML, and it can also be the start of your learning journey towards developing these AIML models in a hands-on manner.</p><p> </p><p>Let us start with the very basics, and I will first define the term artificial intelligence. Now the fact of the matter is this is easier said than done because this term has been around since at least the 1950s, and it has applied to such a broad array of algorithmic techniques and models that it is hard to pin down. A layman's definition would be artificial intelligence is an activity devoted to making machines intelligent, and intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight within its environment.</p><p> </p><p>The idea is that you give these machines the capability to behave and make decisions in a way that is appropriate  for the context in which they operate. Now, it is very easy to say artificial intelligence involves mimicking human intelligence, but this would not be entirely right. So, it is hard to define AI perfectly, and this definition of AI has varied over time. But one thing should be clear in your head is that artificial intelligence is its own kind of intelligence, and it is not actually like human intelligence. Now, you might say something like, oh, AI models can see or perceive objects like human beings. Well, they can perceive objects, but it may not be exactly how we perceive objects. We may try to get them to perceive objects like us, but they are their own kind of intelligence. And to complicate this further, over the last 50 or 70 years, the term AI has come to apply to so many different algorithms and techniques.</p><p> </p><p>Historically, the term artificial intelligence has often been conflated with machine learning, where machine learning refers to algorithms that learn from data. Now, we will dive into machine learning in a little more detail in just  a bit, but you should know that artificial intelligence is more all-encompassing. Traditionally, AI used to refer to machine learning fields as well as non-machine learning fields such as game theory. Another important detail to keep in mind about artificial intelligence is that it refers to a system as a whole.</p><p> </p><p>AI is often powered by a model that enables this intelligence, but AI can be thought of as a term that encompasses the complete system that includes this model. For example, let us say you are interacting with a chatbot such as ChatGPT. The entire system is an example of artificial intelligence, but there is a language model that actually powers the conversation behind the scenes. AI is the system and not just that model.</p><p> </p><p>Now I understand that was a long and detailed introduction to artificial intelligence, but it is a nuanced term, and I wanted to ensure that I got across its subtleties. But the term AI in regular everyday use is not as loaded. It serves as a catchall term for applications that perform human-like tasks without any human intervention. And this is a perfectly reasonable way to talk about artificial intelligence in general conversation.</p><p> </p><p>Now, people working in AI in a big tech company might refer to artificial intelligence as something very, very specific. Their definition of  AI is likely to be the use of deep learning models that perform tasks that extract meaningful representations from data and use that for prediction. Data scientists, engineers, product managers, project managers, people at big tech companies who are closely involved with working on artificial intelligence, may have a very specific meaning when they say AI.</p><p> </p><p>Engineers and data scientists developing these systems may only refer to the model as artificial intelligence and not the system as a whole. In the real world, you are likely to be conversing with people from different fields and different walks of life, when you talk about AI, and it is important that you keep these different perspectives in mind, so you know what AI means in that particular context.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Machine Learning</strong></p><p>With that discussion of AI under our belt,  let us move on to discussing artificial intelligence and machine learning. Now, these two terms are often used interchangeably, but they actually mean very different things. At this point, you have a good big picture understanding of what AI is all about. It is an umbrella term for computer software that mimics human cognition to perform complex, almost human-like tasks. Anytime you see a machine doing something that is almost human-like, maybe its walking, maybe it is detecting obstacles, maybe it is conversing with you. If it does something that seems almost human-like, you refer to that as artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is a very broad term, and artificial intelligence encompasses the field of machine learning. Machine learning is a part or a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms trained on data to produce models that can perform predictive reasoning.</p><p> </p><p>So, machine learning is all about algorithms that can learn from data. You feed in a whole corpus of data to a machine learning algorithm, and once the algorithm has trained on that data, you refer to that as a model. This machine learning model during the training process, has learned generalized patterns that exist in the data, and it can use those patterns for predictions. This is a good intuitive way to distinguish between AI and ML, but I should tell you that out there in the world, there is no standard approach for separating artificial intelligence and machine learning, which is why these two terms are often used together and often used interchangeably.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Deep Learning</strong></p><p>Now another term you are likely to have encountered in the context of artificial intelligence and machine learning is deep learning. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. Just like machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, deep learning is one very specific kind of machine learning that uses advanced models built using neural networks to perform some of the most complex tasks in the world of machine learning. Do not be thrown off by the term neural networks. Neural networks refer to one particular architecture of a machine learning model, which uses active learning units called neurons, arranged in layers to actually learn from data. We will be discussing neural networks in more detail later on.</p><p> </p><p>The most advanced models today, the ones that surprise you and seem almost magical, are all built using deep learning models, which are a subcategory of machine learning models in general.</p><p> </p><p>Now, I had mentioned earlier that the term AI is usually used to refer to the system as a whole, and not just the machine learning model powering the system. So here are some examples of AI that we see here in the real world today. A self-driving car that can navigate traffic and routes on its own. It brings together machine learning models and a bunch of other technologies to make this happen. Another example of AI that is relevant today, is a conversational chatbot that can answer questions and respond to queries. Also, voice assistants such as Alexa or Siri that can respond to voice queries.</p><p> </p><p>AI systems bring together a number of different technologies, but at the heart of an artificial intelligence system is machine learning. Machine learning can be thought of as powering artificial intelligence. For example, self-driving cars use computer vision algorithms to recognize stop signs, signals, and other obstacles that come in the way, and then it takes action accordingly. A conversational chatbot has to understand natural language. It has to recognize patterns in your prompts and your queries, and then understand what they mean, and then produce responses. And if you think about voice assistants, they use speech-to-text models to interact with users, in addition, they need to have an understanding of what is said so that they can respond appropriately. This involves natural language processing as well. </p><h2><strong>What is Generative AI</strong></h2><p>Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content like text, images, music, or even code based on patterns it learned from existing data. Instead of just recognizing things, it has the ability to generate something original, like writing an essay, drawing a picture, or composing a song by imagining what would fit based on its training. </p><p> </p><p>Think of it as a tool that can draft reports, write emails, or generate insights, helping you accomplish tasks more efficiently. Generative AI gained widespread popularity thanks to products like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and others that showcase its power to assist with creative and productive tasks.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Differences Between AI's</strong></p><p>While AI is trained on structured data sets with outputs designed by humans, Generative AI can generate new content such as text, images, and audio based on unstructured as well as structured data sets and can perform work and creative activities while interacting.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How Does it Fit within other AI</strong></p><p>Generative AI fits within other AI technologies by focusing on creating new things rather than just analyzing or recognizing. Traditional AI often classifies, predicts, or identifies patterns like tagging people in photos or sorting emails as spam.</p><p> </p><p>Generative AI, however, makes new content like images, text, or music by building on these foundational skills. In fact, Generative AI is a branch within deep learning and machine learning, as it uses deep learning models through training, learning patterns from data and making predictions. In the case of Generative AI, such predictions are used to generate new content.</p><p> </p><p>Generative AI uses some of the same technology behind understanding language (NLP) and recognizing images(Computer Vision) but goes further by generating creative outputs, like ChatGPT writing a story or Midjourney creating a unique piece of art. Think  of it as the creative side of AI, working alongside more analytical AI tools to broaden what artificial intelligence can do.</p><p> </p><p><strong>LLM's</strong></p><p>LLM, stands for Large Language Model, is a type of Generative AI specialized in working with language. LLMs are able to generate text creatively and coherently, which makes them very useful in tasks such as writing articles, answering questions, or even assisting in content creation.</p><p> </p><p>LLMs are systems pretrained with large volumes of data to solve common language problems such as classifying texts, answering questions, summarizing documents, or generating new texts, and which are then refined to solve specific problems in different industries, sectors, or  activities with a relatively smaller amount of information. In short, to understand in a simple way what an LLM is, think about it as a model that you have read and learned from large amounts of text that can not only understand what you are asking it, but also generate new answers in a way that sounds very natural, as if they had been created by a person from a specific training.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Impact of Generative AI</strong></p><p>Generative AI is reshaping the workspace by enhancing automation and streamlining operations. It enables faster document creation, more efficient customer service interactions and quicker data analysis. By handling time-consuming tasks, it frees you to focus on more strategic aspects of your job, ultimately boosting overall efficiency.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Practical Uses</strong></p><p>Here are some real world applications that can enhance productivity: automated report writing, email assistance, draft summarization, customer service support, code generation, and information extraction.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Adapting to Market Changes</strong></p><p>As AI continues to evolve, it is crucial to adapt and integrate these tools into your workflow. Embracing Generative AI can give you a competitive edge by enhancing your capabilities and productivity. Companies and professionals who leverage AI effectively are likely to outperform those who stick strictly to traditional methods. Generative AI is more than a technological advancement; it is a practical asset that can significantly improve productivity in the workplace.</p><p> </p><p>By understanding its functionalities and applications, you can streamline tasks, save time and focus on what truly matters in your role. Embracing this technology is not just about staying current, it is about unlocking new levels of efficiency and effectiveness in your work. </p><h2><strong>AI in the Workplace</strong></h2><p>Artificial Intelligence or AI is rapidly integrating into our daily lives, enhancing tasks from personalized recommendation and virtual assistants to advanced data analysis and smart home automation. In the workplace, AI is transforming the ways we work and communicate with our colleagues, customers, and business partners.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How AI Will Change How You Work</strong></p><p>Imagine clocking in to work one day and finding out you have just been assigned a personal assistant. There must be a mistake, you tell your boss, I am not a leading executive. I am just a regular employee. However, your boss insists there was no mistake and your assistant is here to stay.</p><p> </p><p>To your surprise, the assistant is very bright. They are skilled at writing emails, summarizing documents, and can answer tough questions accurately across numerous domains. On nearly any task you assign them, your new assistant manages to contribute substantially to the task at hand.</p><p> </p><p>However, these abilities come with some big drawbacks. The assistant is not much of a self starter. They will need you to guide and supervise them at each step of their work. Additionally, your new assistant does not have a human body. Instead, they are a powerful computer program known as a machine learning model that you speak to using a user interface on your computer or phone.</p><p> </p><p>This AI employee can enhance your job satisfaction and open up more opportunities to advance your career. They have a wide range of powerful skills but nonetheless need careful supervision and management to excel. Managing the performance of your AI assistant is a skill with significant payoff for your productivity. By taking care of the more tedious aspects of your job, your assistant frees up your time for more creative, complex, and fulfilling work.</p><p> </p><p>While the rise of AI in the workplace has caused significant concerns from many people, we will hopefully convince you that the mental model we have just outlined is a better way to think about AI. Far from a robotic replacement, AI is more like your own personal junior employee. This employee has a wide range of powerful skills, but needs careful supervision and management to excel.</p><p> </p><p>Let us introduce what kinds of workplace tasks AI can help you with versus what tasks you will still need to do on your own. AI tasks could be writing drafts of content, brainstorming, ideation, or the possible consequences of a decision, simplifying technical or jargon-filled text, summarizing a large document, or maybe translating a paragraph from one language to another.</p><p> </p><p>Human tasks could be revising final drafts of content, making final decisions, handling sensitive situations, knowing what to communicate in an important email, fact-checking the accuracy and relevancy of AI-produced content, or maybe checking a message to someone from a different part of the world for cultural sensitivity.</p><p> </p><p>Just as a two person team at a job can accomplish more than a single person can alone, much of your own work can likely be accomplished faster and of higher quality through the skillful combination of AI and human oversight. We will explore how to use AI effectively in the workplace, focusing on creative, intelligent use of large language models, literacy in the wider world of AI, and ways to mitigate AI's potentially harmful effects.</p><p> </p><p><strong>AI Cases at your Office</strong></p><p>To begin our exploration of how to effectively use AI in the workplace, let us showcase some practical examples of how to use these tools in real life contexts. As you consider each example, think of how you might apply it to your own business tasks.</p><p> </p><p>For our first example, let us explore how we can simplify a complex legal paragraph using AI. We have all encountered work-related writing that hard to parse. GenAI is great at quickly making such writing much more digestible. In this example, we have a piece of legal jargon which Chat GPT will simplify into something less complicated.  So first, let us start by entering our prompt in the ChatGPT's prompt box.</p><p> </p><p>At the prompt, we input, please simplify the following language so an average 19-year-old can understand it. The lessee hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the lessor from any and all claims, liabilities, damages, or expenses arising out of or in connection with the lessee's use of the premises. And then strike enter to process it. ChatGPT simplifies the language into, the renter promises to protect the owner from any problems, costs, or damages that happen because of the renter's use of the property.</p><p> </p><p>As you can see, ChatGPT clarified the language of the first passage, removing unnecessary and cumbersome words. Also, note that we had to give the language model some context. In this case, we instructed ChatGPT to rewrite the confusing sentence so that an average 19 year old could understand it.</p><p> </p><p>Now imagine a messy document of half completed meeting notes. Keep cleaner records of communication by sharing these notes with the AI, instructing it to identify action items, summarize, and format them nicely, and share a higher quality set of documentation for your organization's work. In this demonstration, we are going to explore the messy meeting notes of Clara, a dinosaur researcher who has attended a recent budget meeting.</p><p> </p><p>First, let us briefly look at her notes, which seem disorganized, somewhat random, and frankly, messy.</p><p>Meeting Notes - Dinosaur Researchers</p><p>Funding Issues</p><p>Need more money for excavation</p><p>Team meeting next week</p><p>Samantha: we should apply for more grants</p><p>Budget Review</p><p>Etc…</p><p> </p><p>Ok, while Clara has taken some interesting meeting notes, they are too disorganized to add to her official records. But that is ok because we are going to post her notes to Microsoft's Copilot and have the language model organize it for her. First, let us start by entering our prompt in the Copilot's prompt box. Let us tell the AI what we are doing and what we are looking for. Here is how that will look, hi, my name is Clara. Would you please take the following meeting notes from my dinosaur budget meeting, and organize them for me. Please provide a brief summary of the themes, as well as highlighting what might be some important follow up topics. And then simply paste Clara's meeting notes after that.</p><p> </p><p>Copilot will organize and sort the notes for us. Note how Copilot cleaned the notes and organized them in clean and actionable ways. And Clara can continue to refine the Copilot output by asking to focus in on certain areas, like potential budget issues.</p><p> </p><p>When starting a new project, or developing content, brainstorming is often the first step. AI can rapidly generate a variety of ideas and suggest themes, instructing it to ask you some interesting questions that will help you come up with even better ideas. Then, when you are ready, AI can also help you draft initial versions of content like social media posts or blog articles.</p><p> </p><p>Another popular use of AI is to generate content, for example, AI can help you draft emails quickly and efficiently. Let us return to Clara, our researcher with a dinosaur project, to draft an email to our boss asking for additional funding. In this demonstration, we will explore how AI can assist in content development by brainstorming ideas and drafting initial content. Step 1: Let us start by entering our prompt in the ChatGPT's prompt box. For the prompt, Clara announces her intent to use ChatGPT to draft an email to her boss, I would like you to draft an email to my boss asking about additional funding.</p><p> </p><p>Then, Clara provides the AI with some basic details about the email she needs to write.</p><p>Recipient: Clara's Boss Harold</p><p>Subject: Request for additional funding for dinosaur research project</p><p>Main Point: highlight the importance of the project</p><p>Explain the current funding shortfall</p><p>Specify the amount of additional funding needed</p><p>Mention potential benefits of securing additional funding</p><p>Step 2: AI generates the email</p><p> </p><p>By providing basic details, Clara was able to generate a well structured email requesting additional funding for her project.</p><p> </p><p><strong>AI as a Research Assistant</strong></p><p>Have a question about a new market trend or need a quick explanation of a complex subject? Maybe you are helping a child with a school project. AI, like Google's Gemini, can provide accurate answers and explanations, pulling from a vast range of resources. It is like having a research assistant at your fingertips. However, remember to verify any information the AI shares with you before making important decisions.</p><p> </p><p>Now let us look at another application of AI. In this demo, we are going to use Google's Gemini to learn about dinosaur fossils in South Africa. First, let us start by entering our prompt in the Gemini prompt box. Let us enter a general question about dinosaur fossils, Please tell me about the different types of dinosaur fossils found in Southern Africa. Now, let us pick a specific dinosaur from the list. Now, let us prompt the AI in the Gemini prompt box, tell me about what these Coelophysis ate. And finally, let us learn more about Coelophysis. Enter in the Gemini prompt box the following, what happened to the Coelophysis?</p><p> </p><p>Using this strategy that is going from general to more specific prompts, we can explore all kinds of details about dinosaurs. We could ask follow up questions like, what is the approximate weight of Coelophysis? And perhaps, did the Coelophysis have any predators?, to get more information about this ancient creature.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Integrating AI into Daily Tasks</strong></p><p>These ideas are only the beginning when it comes to using GenAI on your work tasks, but hopefully, they get your ideas flowing if you are still wrapping your mind around the applications of AI at your work. As we discussed in each of these use cases, it is best to think of AI as a kind of personal assistant whose work you must carefully validate and proofread. Relying too much on AI is a serious mistake. However, after skillfully validating the output of AI, integrating these AI capabilities into your daily routine can free up valuable time, reduce repetitive tasks, and help focus on higher level strategic goals. </p><h2><strong>How AI Works Under the Hood</strong></h2><p>Now, let us look at how AI works, and why that is important for how you use it. LLMs are the machine learning models behind the helpful chatbot assistants. While their inner workings are complex, there are a few simple ideas about how they are built that are very helpful for understanding the inherent risks and difficulties of their use. We will break down this complex topic in a beginner friendly way, showing you the practical implications for using these AI tools at work.</p><p> </p><p>Imagine a tool that has read vast amounts of the internet, every blog, article, and more to learn the patterns of language. Its primary job, predicting the next work in any piece of text. After it is proficient at next work predictions, these models undergo further training from mere predictors into helpful assistants ready to respond to user queries.</p><p> </p><p>This second phase uses human preferences to train itself to be friendly and helpful. When you interact with LLMs trained in this way, they are essentially guessing what a helpful assistant would say next. Their guess is based on their vast reading and training that taught them to align to human preferences.</p><p> </p><p>While interacting with these models feels incredibly human, it is important to remember that underneath there is no human style cognition occurring. They are not thinking or understanding. They are just continually predicting texts based on their training. One major implication of this next word prediction is what we call hallucinations. This might sound spooky, but it is actually just the AI continuing to predict text, even if it is incorrect.</p><p> </p><p>Take the following example. Ask an early version of ChatGPT, when were the pyramids of Giza moved across the golden gate bridge for the second time? You would likely get an answer like, the pyramids of Giza were moved across the golden gate bridge for the second time on December 12th 1854. This makes sense if we remember these models were designed to always try their best to generate the most likely next word. Their job is to keep talking. Their job is not only to say true things. Another issue is bias. These models can mirror the prejudices found in their training data. Just like a child raised in a specific environment, these models reflect the patterns around them. This means they can unintentionally reproduce societal biases, which we need to be aware of.</p><p> </p><p><strong>The Wider World of AI</strong></p><p>AI is a wide ranging term used to refer to any computer program that mimics human intelligence. Imagine an automated user support chatbot. When a user submits a query, the chatbot performs a simple keyword search using the words in the query, returning a predefined response depending on what keywords it finds. This chatbot follows a strict set of rules to provide answers and solutions to customers. This is the oldest and simplest form of AI.</p><p> </p><p>Machine learning is a type of AI that uses big data and statistical algorithms to learn patterns. Groundbreaking large language models used in AI tools use machine learning, as do more conventional statistical models used in data science.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Deep Learning</strong></p><p>Deep learning is a special type of machine learning that uses huge datasets with equally huge machine learning models, known as neural networks. These types of models are especially powerful on complex tasks with many variables.</p><p> </p><p><strong>GenAI</strong></p><p>Finally, generative AI, such as conventional chatbot AIs and image detectors belong to a subset of deep learning. These models at the cutting edge of AI are what we mean when we say generative AI. There is a lot of focus on the type of GenAI known as large language models, which use text as both their input and output. It is important to broaden our understanding to include various other AI technologies that are transforming our work environments.</p><p> </p><p>First, text generation is done by large language models. Image creation is done with tools such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, or Dall-E. You can use AI to generate audio/music with a tool like Suno. And lastly, you can use Sora to generate AI videos. Audio visual technologies such as image, video, and audio generators are revolutionizing content creation.

These measures empower individuals to interact with AI generated content responsibly, reducing the potential risks and consequences associated with AI driven misinformation or malicious content. </p><h2><strong>AI Security Risks</strong></h2><p>Today we are going to talk about some of the more common AI security risks, including AI model attacks, data security risks, code maintainability, and supply chain complexity. These security risks  are why we are starting to see more emphasis on creating secure AI models and implementing privacy preserving AI systems. These AI systems are designed, created, tested, and procured with security and privacy in mind.</p><p> </p><p>They are specifically tailored to reduce the likelihood of such a risk being actualized into an attack. In terms of risks around our data security, we are going to have some vulnerabilities with our AI pipeline. Any kind of software is going to have some sort of vulnerability present within it and AI based software is no different. This means that all of the pipeline operations around our AI model such as collection, storage, and usage of our data are going to be subject to various vulnerability risks. And this includes our production data. Compounding this risk factor is the fact that AI models and their associated data often make use of cloud based services which come with their own set of risks and complications in terms of making sure that your data and usage of those cloud services are secure.</p><p> </p><p>This means that when it comes to data security, we have a very wide attack surface that we need to protect and try to reduce. There are also attacks that can target the AI model itself, and these attacks often aim at compromising some combination of the AI model's integrity, its reliability, and its security. The common attack vector for AI models is through the inputs that get fed into the model. Malicious actors will try to use inputs that deliberately mislead or confuse an AI model in order to get the model to produce inconsistent or erroneous results. They can also try to use malformed inputs to perform things similar to SQL injection attacks in order to try and exploit software vulnerabilities within the AI model itself. So, let us take a look at some specific attack types that represent risks to our AI model.</p><p> </p><p>The first is data poisoning. A data poisoning attack is when a malicious actor tries to manipulate or change training data in some way to alter the behavior of the model. An example of this would be a malicious actor altering the training data of an anomaly detection system to reduce the accuracy rate of that detection system in order to have a piece of malicious software bypass the detection system. Where data poisoning tries to actually alter the behavior of the AI model fundamentally through the training data, input manipulation is done on a production AI model where malicious actors try to feed erroneous or malformed inputs into the AI model to get it to act incorrectly or in an inconsistent way. This is another significant risk to the AI model itself because we do not want our AI model to be behaving in a way in which we have not tested it or in which we have not validated it in production. Another attack type is model inversion. A model inversion attack is where a malicious actor tries to reverse engineer the outputs from an AI model in order to extract personally identifiable information about a subject based on that output.</p><p> </p><p>Effectively, an attacker trains a new AI model using output from your AI model as the input to their AI model. And in this way, they try to train their AI model to predict the inputs that produce a given output for your model, which can lead to a compromise of your data privacy. Along the same lines, we also have the attack type of membership inference. Membership inference is where a malicious actor also tries to figure out if a given person's information has been used to train a model using related known information from the AI model itself. Beyond specific attacks, there are other AI security risks that we need to look out for. The first is AI code reuse. A huge number of various AI projects available today, all rely on a small group of the same publicly available libraries. This means that a huge number of AI models are all sourcing from the same code base.</p><p> </p><p>As such, if there are any security or privacy problems with that shared code base, those problems are going to extend to every AI model making use of that code base. So, if a given model's creator does not do their due diligence to ensure that the code libraries they Are making use of are secure and free from any critical vulnerabilities, then the AI models themselves will be subject to those critical vulnerabilities and represent a security risk in your environment. The complexity of the supply chain surrounding AI models also represents a security risk. This is because the supply chain surrounding AI models typically draws from a wide variety of different sources for all of the different factors that go into creating an AI model and increasing the supply chain complexity increases the opportunity for malicious actors to perform a malicious activity at some point along the chain and inject a piece of malicious software or hardware into your AI model. These supply chain attacks are particularly difficult to defend against because so much of the supply chain ends up out of your direct control and you have to rely on a third party vendor's security.</p><p> </p><p>This is where good public auditing can come into play and doing your due diligence in investigating the security track record and proofs from all of the third party vendors involved in every aspect of your supply chain. On the software development side, we also have a risk around the AI code maintainability. The inner workings of an AI model can quickly become very complex  to the point that it can be difficult even for the people who designed the model to explain what is happening inside of the model's decision making process. As such, going forward in the code's life cycle, as new developers cycle in and older developers cycle out, it can be difficult to perform updates or understand at all how the AI model  is coming to its decisions.</p><p> </p><p>This represents a risk because the more difficult a codebase is to update, the more likely it is to become out of date and subject to new vulnerabilities. So, as we have seen, there are many AI security risks that we need to account for surrounding data protection. </p><h2><strong>How AI Works with Data</strong></h2><p>AI works by combining large amounts of data with fast, iterative processing and intelligent algorithms, allowing the software to learn automatically from patterns or features in the data. An important thing to note here, AI will only learn from the data it has.</p><p> </p><p>So, as we use algorithms to make decisions, make sure that the data is valid and that any biases are accounted for and corrected.</p><p> </p><p>Today, you can collect data in many formats. We can classify data into four major groups. We have structured, semi-structured, quasi-structured, and unstructured.</p><p> </p><p>Let us look at the characteristics of each type of data as well as some examples.</p><p> </p><p>Structured data is a format that is probably familiar to you. This type of data is clearly labeled and organized in a neat table. Microsoft Excel is an example of structured data that you have probably seen and used before. In terms of advantages, it is easy to manipulate and display.</p><p> </p><p>However, because it is so rigid, it is not suitable for many data sources that cannot be quickly categorized into rows and columns. Excel also has a limitation in terms of the amount of data that it can hold, and especially as your dataset grows, it can become slow and prevent you from doing calculations. So it is not always the best tool as your data continues to grow.</p><p> </p><p>One step beyond structured data is semi-structured data. This format is labeled and can be found in a nested style. White it is organized, it is not in a table format.</p><p> </p><p>So, it is a little more versatile and can incorporate different data sources, without needing to change the structure. It is important to remember that this versatility can become unwieldy, so you should be mindful about the number of attributes to include. Examples include email metadata and XML.</p><p> </p><p>Next on the list is quasi-structured data. This has some patterns in the way it is presented, but it does not come with clear labels or structure.</p><p> </p><p>It does not have metadata like semi-structured data, so it requires more work to format and sort through. Quasi-structured data includes clickstream data and Google search results.</p><p> </p><p>Last but not least is unstructured data, which is considered to be the most abundant type of data that exists today. This is data that does not have any pre-defined format. When we think about the wealth of information on the internet today, such as videos, podcasts, pictures, all of these formats are considered unstructured.</p><p> </p><p>While it allows us to look at more data, it does take a lot of time and effort to format the information for analysis. One piece that you should keep in mind is the amount of compute power that it can take to actually process this information.</p><p> </p><p>So what exactly is big data? The definition has been described as the three V's. Characteristics of big data include High Volume. Typically, the size of big data is described in terabytes, petabytes, and even exabytes, much more than could be on a regular laptop.</p><p> </p><p>It requires high velocity. Big data flows from sources at a rapid and continuous pace. And there should be a high level of variety. Big data comes into different formats from heterogeneous sources. If you are working with big data, see if those criteria fit with the information that you are working with.</p><p> </p><p>Good quality of data leads to more accurate AI results, because it matches the problem that AI is addressing. Consistent data simplifies the data analysis process. When we are talking about quality data, there are a few components to keep in mind.</p><p> </p><p>Incomplete data can lead to AI models missing important insights, so completeness in data is crucial for accurate AI training. This means that there are not many missing rows or columns.</p><p> </p><p>Inaccurate data can cause AI models to generate unreliable insights and predictions. Accuracy in data is important for effective AI training, ensuring that the information used to teach the models reflects the real-world scenario as closely as possible.</p><p> </p><p>Invalid data can undermine the integrity of AI models and jeopardize the reliability of their outcomes. Ensuring data is valid is crucial for building dependable AI models that follow specific rules.</p><p> </p><p>This boosts the overall quality and trustworthiness of the insights these models provide. Inconsistent data can introduce errors and decrease the reliability and performance of AI models.</p><p> </p><p>It is essential to have consistent data for reliable AI training and better predictive capabilities. When we are talking about consistent data, we are talking about uniform and standardized data across various sources.</p><p> </p><p>So, for example, making sure that your variables are named consistently across different data sources. Relevant data is essential for AI to focus on what matters while irrelevant data can lead to confusion and inefficiency in models, and ultimately will not answer the question that you are asking.</p><p> </p><p>It is also important to have fresh and current data, because old data can lead to predicting wrong outputs in terms of current patterns and trends. So while it is important to look at historical data in order to gather some of those trends, you want to make sure that you infuse it with current patterns to see how that might have shifted, and to make sure that the algorithm is taking that into account.</p><p> </p><p>Using low quality data can negatively impact an AI application. Training a machine learning model with inaccurate or missing data leads to the wrong classification, unreliable recommendations, lower accuracy, and possible bias.</p><p> </p><p>For example, a car's object detection system could not recognize a truck as an obstacle due to a flawed algorithm that was not designed to detect it from a particular angle. Because the training data lacked sufficient images of large trucks from that angle.</p><p> </p><p>Outdated data collected significantly in the past, or obtained from  different data sources, has the potential to negatively impact AI and ML models. This can result in reduced accuracy and introduce bias into the model.</p><p> </p><p>For example, an algorithm learned from a decade of resumes submitted to Amazon that a successful application usually meant that that person identified as male, that led to gender bias in terms of the selection of resumes for interviews, and has been discarded by Amazon.</p><p> </p><p>Having enough relevant and good quality data is important for AI systems to work effectively. It is crucial to balance the quantity and quality of the data for reliable outcomes, especially in AI applications.</p><p> </p><p>Having more data results in improved statistical strength. It helps reduce the sampling bias. It empowers the use of more complex models. It captures a broader range of variations and patterns in data. And it catches more variability.</p><p> </p><p>All of these pieces need to be considered before you use these datasets within your model.</p><h2><strong>Prompt Engineering with AI</strong></h2><p>It can be frustrating to insert prompt after prompt into generative AI tools and not get the responses we are looking for. As we work with generative AI, it is important to remember the way we ask for information matters. An effective prompt can be the difference between getting what we want and getting useless noise.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Use Clear Language</strong></p><p>Clarity is key when engineering prompts. A clear and concise prompt will make it easier for the AI to understand your request and provide you with relevant, high quality output. When writing a prompt for generative AI, aim for a specific and simple prompt that is free from spelling and grammatical errors.</p><p> </p><p>While being specific increases the size of the prompt, we should also get rid of unnecessary information, jargon, confusing phrases, mistakes, any of which can lead the AI down the wrong path. For example, instead of: 'my team is interested in x, tell me about that', consider: 'provide a summary of x, including its history, features, and configuration'.</p><p> </p><p>By using clear language, you increase the chances of receiving accurate and useful information from your generative AI tool.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Every Prompt Has A Purpose</strong></p><p>It is hard for the AI to give you what you want if it does not know what you are asking for. The first step in creating an effective prompt for generative AI tools is to define its purpose. Think about factors like:</p><ol type="1"><li value="1">Tone: How do you want the output to sounds? Funny? Professional?</li><li>Format: How do you want the output structured? Bullet list? Paragraph? An essay?</li><li>Audience: Who is this for? Do you want something for children? Beginners? Experts?</li></ol><p> </p><p>By considering these and incorporating our answers into the prompt, we can produce much more targeted results from the AI. Consider a prompt like the following: 'Write about artificial intelligence'. As opposed to: 'Write structure for a brief presentation on the use of artificial intelligence for a manufacturing business. The tone should be professional and aimed at business executives'.</p><p> </p><p>Which do you think will get us closer to our goals? Next time you are using a generative AI tool, consider the goal you are trying to achieve and consider how you can present it using the prompt. This will likely bring the output much closer to what you are looking for.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Include Important Context</strong></p><p>Context is crucial when engineering prompts. Providing relevant background information can improve the AI's understanding of your request and lead to more accurate responses.</p><p> </p><p>Include any details that are essential to understanding your request, such as historical context or related concepts. Instead : 'My code is throwing an error', Consider: This line of code is throwing the exception'.</p><p> </p><p>If there are specific limitations or requirements, make them clear in your prompt. While context is important, avoid providing too much information, as it may confuse the AI or cause it to focus on less important aspects of your request.</p><p> </p><p>For example, instead of:</p><p>'Explain how to use a computer program'</p><p>Using our previous strategies, we would have:</p><p>'Explain how to use a photo editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop, for beginners who have never worked with image editing tools'.</p><p>Using our new tips, we would add:</p><p>'Focus on basic functions like cropping, resizing, and adjusting color levels'.</p><p> </p><p>By including important context, you help the generative AI tool understand your request more thoroughly and produce a response that better meets your needs.</p><p> </p><p>In this guide, we covered some of the ways to effectively engineer prompts when working with generative AI tools. An effective prompt can make the difference in getting the information that we want. In summary, we should:</p><ol type="1"><li value="1">Use clear language. Get rid of unnecessary information, jargon, confusing phrases, and mistakes.</li><li>Define the purpose of the prompt using concepts like tone, format, and audience.</li><li>Include important context: If there are specific limitations or requirements, make them clear in your prompt.</li><li>Provide examples</li></ol></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 26, 2025</p><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fai-explained.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fai-explained.html&amp;via=_Aindien&amp;text=AI%20Explained" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://aindien.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://aindien.com/technical-writing-explained.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Technical Writing Explained</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-12-26T23:12" class="feed__date">December 26, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/cloud-fundamentals.html" class="invert">Cloud Computing Explained</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-12-23T16:27" class="feed__date">December 23, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/python-basics.html" class="invert">Python Explained</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-10-13T17:44" class="feed__date">October 13, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/economics-essentials.html" class="invert">Economics Explained</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><style type="text/css">#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }
