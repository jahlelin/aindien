Essentially it pushes data around to devices and controls what happens. Some of the more interesting uses for a network now is VOIP communications and video conferencing. In this guide to network communications I go over some of those details.</p><p> </p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Guide To Network Communications</strong></h2><p>First of all, the network communications in a business or organization can take on many forms. A business or individual may use part or even all of these types of communications. In conclusion, they each have their use cases and advantages.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">Voice over IP.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Video broadcasts.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Surveillance.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Collaboration software.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Quality of Service.</span></li></ul><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-697 size-large"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/network_communications3-1024x410.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/responsive/network_communications3-1024x410-xs.png 300w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/responsive/network_communications3-1024x410-sm.png 480w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/responsive/network_communications3-1024x410-md.png 768w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/responsive/network_communications3-1024x410-lg.png 1024w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/responsive/network_communications3-1024x410-xl.png 1360w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/responsive/network_communications3-1024x410-2xl.png 1600w" alt="network_communications" width="1024" height="410"></figure><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Voice over IP</strong></h3><p>Voice over IP is used in many if not most business environments today. You can get a lot of cool features with these types of phones and save a ton of money over traditional phone services. Another reason this has become so popular is because it uses the same Ethernet cabling as the rest of our network.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Video Broadcasts</strong></h3><p>Video of most varieties can also travel over the network, so others can see it. This can be a streaming event like a webinar or just something made locally by a department that needs to be seen by the entire organization.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Surveillance</strong></h3><p>Surveillance and security cameras are also part of this. They may not get sent out as videos very often but the footage sometimes needs to be seen. Among your typical network communications this is often the most important but also the least used.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Collaboration Software</strong></h3><p>Another nice advantage of network services is collaboration software. This can be something that helps with documents or even some sort of chat software like Cisco stuff or Slack.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Quality of Service</strong></h3><p>Quality of service is essentially several mechanisms working together to guarantee delivery of time sensitive packets. This is important because too much data loss with one of the previously mentioned services will cause it not to work. Furthermore, we need a quality of service that is at least to a certain point so we can do our work.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">Data can be classified by address or application type.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Once it is classified it can be prioritized by the traffic type that works for your business.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">For example we can make voice traffic a higher priority than other types of traffic.</span></li></ul><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Network Virtualization</strong></h3><p>Virtualization allows you to connect virtual machines and devices to a network in the same way that you connect physical devices. You can connect these virtual machines without using a physical network adapter. Consequently, this is becoming one of the most important types of network communications as it is becoming central to all that we do.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">This makes it easy to build a complex network.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">No need to invest in a large amount of expensive physical hardware.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">This model supports a high number of virtual networks on just one physical network adapter.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">These networks and network devices will use our current DHCP server.</span></li></ul><p>Virtual machines connect to a network through a computer with a network adapter. It can connect to all computers connected to that network adapter. Without using a network adapter it exists as part of an internal virtual machine network. This process does require virtual components to function which acts in a similar way to their physical counterparts in a physical network.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Network Virtualization Devices</strong></h3><ul><li><a href="http://aindien.com/networking-basics-applications-network-devices.html">Virtual Switch</a></li></ul><p>A virtual switch allows you to connect virtual servers to separate lans. Since they behave the same as a physical switch a virtual switch allows you to separate traffic for security and quality of service reasons.</p><ul><li><a href="http://aindien.com/computer-networking-networking-hardware.html">Virtual router</a></li></ul><p>This virtual device will also allow you to route traffic between <a href="http://aindien.com/computer-networking-devices.html">devices</a> just as a real firewall would.</p><ul><li>Virtual firewall</li></ul><p>These filter packets and monitor traffic.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Storage Area Network</strong></h3><p>This is any high performance network whose primary purpose is to enable storage devices to communicate with computer systems and with each other. This gives us fault tolerance and redundancy with our storage.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">Storage devices provide access to shared block level data storage.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">This is used to make storage devices accessible to servers so that the operating system sees them as locally attached devices.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">The server accesses the storage at the block level.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">The storage appears locally attached like an internal disk.</span></li></ul><h3 style="text-align: center;">Fiber Channel</h3><p>Fiber channel is often used as the network communications protocol in a storage area network. A storage area network is often made up of multiple fiber channel switches.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Network Attached Storage</strong></h3><p>This is a file level data storage device. It will not appear as a local storage device.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">It attaches directly to a network much like computers and servers.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Provides data access and file storage to computer systems on the network.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Effectively replaces one or more file servers by providing the central storage locations for users data.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Accessing data storage from network attached storage is done over the IP network using file level protocols.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">The operating system level of the computers and servers do not appear to have the data storage available locally.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Users have to access data as a file share over the network.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Creating file shares on the network attached storage devices enables other computer systems to connect to the shares.</span></li></ul><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cloud Computing</strong></h3><p>Cloud computing provides access to network communications resources such as services, applications, servers, network infrastructure, and storage on a distributed network. Therefore, this is all on the internet and is basically someone else's resources.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">Users access these resources by networking and various internet protocols.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">There are several service models we use in cloud computing and each has their advantages.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is physical devices.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Platform as a Service (PaaS).</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Software as a Service (SaaS) include any kind of application.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">the hosting provider owns all of this physical infrastructure and rents it to you.</span></li></ul><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Infrastructure as a Service</strong></h3><p>Infrastructure as a Service is talking about your physical devices. It is the lowest <a href="http://aindien.com/how-the-osi-model-works/">level</a> of the network communications. This can be routers, switches, computers, printers, storage devices, power units, racks, locks on doors, and cooling. You can see there is a lot to it. All of this is essential though.</p><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-695 size-large"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/network_communications1-1024x455.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/responsive/network_communications1-1024x455-xs.png 300w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/responsive/network_communications1-1024x455-sm.png 480w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/responsive/network_communications1-1024x455-md.png 768w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/responsive/network_communications1-1024x455-lg.png 1024w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/responsive/network_communications1-1024x455-xl.png 1360w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/responsive/network_communications1-1024x455-2xl.png 1600w" alt="network communications" width="1024" height="455"></figure><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">This infrastructure can replace aging units in your office.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">You can have a separate site that is a backup in case your main office goes down.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">This can also fulfill a temporary need for resource expansion.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">It can help you spread out in other geographical areas.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">You can use infrastructure to help with increased loads to a server.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">If you have a short lived project you can rent infrastructure to help and give you more computing power.</span></li></ul><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Platform as a Service</strong></h3><p>Platform as a Service sits just on top of the infrastructure. This usually deals with virtualization and the operating system layer. A platform can be Windows, Linux or BSD. Virtualization refers to a type a hypervisor such as VMWare, Hyper-v, KVM, or Xen.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">The cloud provider is the owner of the platform and as a customer can make use of it.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">The cloud provider manages the installation of the operating system and the hypervisor.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">It can be used for temporary acces to the physical infrastructure and operating system.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">If you do not have the skills to use KVM for example you can let a provider manage this for you.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">You can also rent this if you have a general lack of maintenance skills.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">It can help with development and testing if you do not have the resources in house to do it.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">This gives you access to that infrastructure that runs it and also gives you a backup for your running applications.</span></li></ul><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Software as a Service</strong></h3><p>Software as a Service is the top layer of the overall cloud infrastructure. This functionality offers complete applications to the cloud user. A good example of this that most people use is hosted email.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">More examples include web applications, file sharing, business applications, and music services.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">The cloud provider proves access and maintenance to the application.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">We can use this when we want to avoid application and software maintenance tasks.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Another time is when we have outdated software and not enough money to buy new licenses.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">We can use software as a service if we lack the skills to support the existing applications.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">It allows us to focus on the business side of things without hiring an IT department.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Costs can be greatly reduced by using software as a service because we do not have to have all the infrastructure and people to run it.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">This is also useful to help with testing applications.</span></li></ul><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Cloud Deployment Models</strong></h3><p>There are different deployment models for cloud computing and hence each describes a way that cloud infrastructure is deployed privately or to the public.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">Public cloud computing.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Private cloud computing.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Hybrid cloud computing.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Community cloud computing.</span></li></ul><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-696 size-full"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/network_communications2.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/responsive/network_communications2-xs.png 300w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/responsive/network_communications2-sm.png 480w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/responsive/network_communications2-md.png 768w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/responsive/network_communications2-lg.png 1024w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/responsive/network_communications2-xl.png 1360w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/24/responsive/network_communications2-2xl.png 1600w" alt="network communications" width="1013" height="714"></figure><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Public Cloud Computing</strong></h3><p>This will be hosted off site. It is owned by a third party company that sells cloud services to the public in a multi tenant fashion. This means they will have many customers for their services.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">This is usually available to all members of the public or large groups within an industry.</span></li></ul><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Private Cloud Computing</strong></h3><p>This is typically built to be used within an organization. It will most often be developed and run by the organization's IT department, however, it could also be held off site and run by a third party.  A business might develop a private cloud offering in another geographic location so that its employees there have the same resources.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hybrid Cloud Computing</strong></h3><p>This is just a combination of different types. A business would do this if a particular combination fit their business model better. These different cloud models will maintain their own characteristics but are bound together to form a single unit.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">They can also offer standardized access to data and applications.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">A business in the process of converting to cloud computing might use a hybrid cloud while they transition from traditional storage to cloud based storage.</span></li></ul><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Community Cloud Computing</strong></h3><p>A community cloud model is an open inter-network that enables clients to find resources on demand. This is important because it separates an organization from cloud resource providers. There are usually no contracts or agreements that are needed before clients can access the content they require.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Basic Network Requirements</strong></h3><p>To implement all of the previously mentioned communication types there are a few basic requirements that you need. I want to go over those now. Most basic networks need centralized network components like a router and a switch. There are others too that you need to make use of typical network communications. As a result, there are many kinds of devices and ideas to consider.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">Computers, laptops, tablets, cell phones, and printers.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Routers, switches, and firewalls.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">VOIP phones, network storage, and access points.</span></li></ul><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Requirements To Consider</strong></h3><p>First, it helps if you have an idea of the number of computers, switches, and access points you will have on your network. Consequently, you will want to make sure your devices are large enough for your current needs plus any future <a href="http://aindien.com/scaling-network-2016.html">growth</a>.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">Internet connectivity - How much bandwidth do you need?</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Wireless connections - You will want a sufficient number of these if you choose to allow wireless at all.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Connectivity of peripherals - Consider how many and where these will be connected.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Access point locations - having good signal is important with the number of laptops,cell phones, and tablets that users bring to work these days.</span></li></ul><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Network Compatibility</strong></h3><p>Not everyone will have the latest technology so we need to make sure they can use our network and resources. We typically do not have to worry about Ethernet because those network interfaces have some built in backwards compatibility. Therefore, if you have multiple locations then you need to have your routers be able to work with each other.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>WiFi Compatibility</strong></h3><p>The current wireless interfaces are 802.11ac and 802.11n but they will also support older wireless standards as well. So it is nice that a lot of hardware has built in backwards compatibility. You should still try to plan for using current standards if at all possible though.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Environmental Requirements</strong></h3><p>Sometimes our network and its equipment is affected by the environment. Electromagnetic interference is one of the things that can affect our network's performance. An example is our Ethernet cables can be affected by lights in our building. That is the environment lowering our performance. Another example is power cables can cause interference if they are run too closely to the Ethernet cables. Wireless interference is also something you need to pay attention to. There are lots of different kinds of wireless devices and some will certainly affect the performance of your network.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Security Requirements</strong></h3><p>Security is a very important topic. When setting up your network communications devices you will want to use private IP addresses inside your network.
