You can do much more than hardware programming in it though. In this article I combine C++ with a basic physics experiment. I show how to read data from a file with C++. I use this data to calculate gravity on Earth. Hopefully I can get close. C++ is so flexible as you can see. That is why I choose to use it still and do tutorials on it. This lesson is over how to read data from a Â file. This is still information in a first semester course but I have been busy lately.
