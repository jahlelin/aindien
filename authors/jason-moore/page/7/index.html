Since computers never break or malfunction, (sarcastic tone if you can't tell) it pays to know a few things to try.</p><p>Sometimes, though,  you just have to send it off and let people like myself work on it.

Despite its age it is still being updated and is one of the top languages around. For hardware programming it is still king and nothing will take its place any time soon. You can do much more than hardware programming in it though. In this article I combine C++ with a basic physics experiment. I show how to read data from a file with C++. I use this data to calculate gravity on Earth. Hopefully I can get close. C++ is so flexible as you can see. That is why I choose to use it still and do tutorials on it. This lesson is over how to read data from a  file. This is still information in a first semester course but I have been busy lately. I plan to write articles well past the first semester so keep checking back.
