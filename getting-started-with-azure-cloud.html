Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. Cloud services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI).<br><br>Because cloud computing uses the internet to deliver these services, it doesn’t have to be constrained by physical infrastructure the same way that a traditional datacenter is. That means if you need to increase your IT infrastructure rapidly, you don’t have to wait to build a new datacenter—you can use the cloud to rapidly expand your IT footprint.</p><h2><br><strong>Describe the shared responsibility model</strong></h2><p>You may have heard of the shared responsibility model, but you may not understand what it means or how it impacts cloud computing.<br><br>Start with a traditional corporate datacenter. The company is responsible for maintaining the physical space, ensuring security, and maintaining or replacing the servers if anything happens. The IT department is responsible for maintaining all the infrastructure and software needed to keep the datacenter up and running. They’re also likely to be responsible for keeping all systems patched and on the correct version.<br><br>With the shared responsibility model, these responsibilities get shared between the cloud provider and the consumer. Physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity are the responsibility of the cloud provider. The consumer isn’t collocated with the datacenter, so it wouldn’t make sense for the consumer to have any of those responsibilities.<br><br>At the same time, the consumer is responsible for the data and information stored in the cloud. (You wouldn’t want the cloud provider to be able to read your information.) The consumer is also responsible for access security, meaning you only give access to those who need it.<br><br>Then, for some things, the responsibility depends on the situation. If you’re using a cloud SQL database, the cloud provider would be responsible for maintaining the actual database. However, you’re still responsible for the data that gets ingested into the database. If you deployed a virtual machine and installed an SQL database on it, you’d be responsible for database patches and updates, as well as maintaining the data and information stored in the database.<br><br>With an on-premises datacenter, you’re responsible for everything. With cloud computing, those responsibilities shift. The shared responsibility model is heavily tied into the cloud service types (covered later in this learning path): infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). IaaS places the most responsibility on the consumer, with the cloud provider being responsible for the basics of physical security, power, and connectivity. On the other end of the spectrum, SaaS places most of the responsibility with the cloud provider. PaaS, being a middle ground between IaaS and SaaS, rests somewhere in the middle and evenly distributes responsibility between the cloud provider and the consumer.<br><br>When using a cloud provider, you’ll always be responsible for:<br><br>The information and data stored in the cloud<br>Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)<br>The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization<br>The cloud provider is always responsible for:<br><br>The physical datacenter<br>The physical network<br>The physical hosts<br>Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:<br><br>Operating systems<br>Network controls<br>Applications<br>Identity and infrastructure</p><h2><br><strong>Define cloud models</strong></h2><p>What are cloud models? The cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. The three main cloud models are: private, public, and hybrid.<br><br>Private cloud<br>Let’s start with a private cloud. A private cloud is, in some ways, the natural evolution from a corporate datacenter. It’s a cloud (delivering IT services over the internet) that’s used by a single entity. Private cloud provides much greater control for the company and its IT department. However, it also comes with greater cost and fewer of the benefits of a public cloud deployment. Finally, a private cloud may be hosted from your on site datacenter. It may also be hosted in a dedicated datacenter offsite, potentially even by a third party that has dedicated that datacenter to your company.<br><br>Public cloud<br>A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. With a public cloud, anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources. The general public availability is a key difference between public and private clouds.<br><br>Hybrid cloud<br>A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment. A hybrid cloud environment can be used to allow a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources. Hybrid cloud can be used to provide an extra layer of security. For example, users can flexibly choose which services to keep in public cloud and which to deploy to their private cloud infrastructure.<br><br>Multi-cloud<br>A fourth, and increasingly likely scenario is a multi-cloud scenario. In a multi-cloud scenario, you use multiple public cloud providers. Maybe you use different features from different cloud providers. Or maybe you started your cloud journey with one provider and are in the process of migrating to a different provider. Regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.<br><br>Azure Arc<br>Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment. Azure Arc can help manage your cloud environment whether it's a public cloud solely on Azure, a private cloud in your datacenter, a hybrid configuration, or even a multi-cloud environment running on multiple cloud providers at once.<br><br>Azure VMware Solution<br>What if you’re already established with VMware in a private cloud environment but want to migrate to a public or hybrid cloud? Azure VMware Solution lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.</p><h2><br><strong>Describe the consumption-based model</strong></h2><p>When comparing IT infrastructure models, there are two types of expenses to consider. Capital expenditure (CapEx) and operational expenditure (OpEx).<br><br>CapEx is typically a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle are examples of CapEx.<br><br>In contrast, OpEx is spending money on services or products over time. Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.<br><br>Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model. With cloud computing, you don’t pay for the physical infrastructure, the electricity, the security, or anything else associated with maintaining a datacenter. Instead, you pay for the IT resources you use. If you don’t use any IT resources this month, you don’t pay for any IT resources.<br><br>This consumption-based model has many benefits, including:<br><br>No upfront costs.<br>No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.<br>The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.<br>The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.<br>With a traditional datacenter, you try to estimate the future resource needs. If you overestimate, you spend more on your datacenter than you need to and potentially waste money. If you underestimate, your datacenter will quickly reach capacity and your applications and services may suffer from decreased performance. Fixing an under-provisioned datacenter can take a long time. You may need to order, receive, and install more hardware. You'll also need to add power, cooling, and networking for the extra hardware.<br><br>In a cloud-based model, you don’t have to worry about getting the resource needs just right. If you find that you need more virtual machines, you add more. If the demand drops and you don’t need as many virtual machines, you remove machines as needed. Either way, you’re only paying for the virtual machines that you use, not the “extra capacity” that the cloud provider has on hand.</p><h2><br><strong>Compare cloud pricing models</strong></h2><p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model. You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:<br><br>Plan and manage your operating costs.<br>Run your infrastructure more efficiently.<br>Scale as your business needs change.<br>To put it another way, cloud computing is a way to rent compute power and storage from someone else’s datacenter. You can treat cloud resources like you would resources in your own datacenter. However, unlike in your own datacenter, when you're done using cloud resources, you give them back. You’re billed only for what you use.<br><br>Instead of maintaining CPUs and storage in your datacenter, you rent them for the time that you need them. The cloud provider takes care of maintaining the underlying infrastructure for you. The cloud enables you to quickly solve your toughest business challenges and bring cutting-edge solutions to your users.<br><br>What is Microsoft Azure<br>Azure is a continually expanding set of cloud services that help you meet current and future business challenges. Azure gives you the freedom to build, manage, and deploy applications on a massive global network using your favorite tools and frameworks.<br><br>What does Azure offer?<br>Limitless innovation. Build intelligent apps and solutions with advanced technology, tools, and services to take your business to the next level. Seamlessly unify your technology to simplify platform management and to deliver innovations efficiently and securely on a trusted cloud.<br><br>Bring ideas to life: Build on a trusted platform to advance your organization with industry-leading AI and cloud services.<br>Seamlessly unify: Efficiently manage all your infrastructure, data, analytics, and AI solutions across an integrated platform.<br>Innovate on trust: Rely on trusted technology from a partner who's dedicated to security and responsibility.<br>What can I do with Azure?<br>Azure provides more than 100 services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines to exploring new software paradigms, such as intelligent bots and mixed reality.<br><br>Many teams start exploring the cloud by moving their existing applications to virtual machines (VMs) that run in Azure. Migrating your existing apps to VMs is a good start, but the cloud is much more than a different place to run your VMs.<br><br>For example, Azure provides artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning (ML) services that can naturally communicate with your users through vision, hearing, and speech. It also provides storage solutions that dynamically grow to accommodate massive amounts of data. Azure services enable solutions that aren't feasible without the power of the cloud.</p><h2><br><strong>Get started with Azure accounts</strong></h2><p>To create and use Azure services, you need an Azure subscription. When you're working with your own applications and business needs, you need to create an Azure account, and a subscription will be created for you. After you've created an Azure account, you're free to create additional subscriptions. For example, your company might use a single Azure account for your business and separate subscriptions for development, marketing, and sales departments. After you've created an Azure subscription, you can start creating Azure resources within each subscription.<br><br>If you're new to Azure, you can sign up for a free account on the Azure website to start exploring at no cost to you. When you're ready, you can choose to upgrade your free account. You can also create a new subscription that enables you to start paying for Azure services you need beyond the limits of a free account.<br><br>Create an Azure account<br>You can purchase Azure access directly from Microsoft by signing up on the Azure website or through a Microsoft representative. You can also purchase Azure access through a Microsoft partner. Cloud Solution Provider partners offer a range of complete managed-cloud solutions for Azure.<br><br>What is the Azure free account?<br>The Azure free account includes:<br><br>Free access to popular Azure products for 12 months.<br>A credit to use for the first 30 days.<br>Access to more than 25 products that are always free.<br>The Azure free account is an excellent way for new users to get started and explore. To sign up, you need a phone number, a credit card, and a Microsoft or GitHub account. The credit card information is used for identity verification only. You won't be charged for any services until you upgrade to a paid subscription.<br><br>What is the Azure free student account?<br>The Azure free student account offer includes:<br><br>Free access to certain Azure services for 12 months.<br>A credit to use in the first 12 months.<br>Free access to certain software developer tools.<br>The Azure free student account is an offer for students that gives $100 credit and free developer tools. Also, you can sign up without a credit card.</p><h2><br><strong>Access the Azure Portal</strong></h2><p>The Azure portal provides a graphic user interface (GUI) to interact with Azure services. You can navigate to different service areas, manage subscriptions and accounts, search for specific services or settings, and so on.<br><br>The Azure portal is accessed at https://portal.azure.com<br><br>Once you're logged into the portal, you can navigate around Azure using the interface, or you can use the command line interface with PowerShell and BASH commands.<br><br>Use the command line interface<br>You can use the CLI from within the Azure portal. Once logged into Azure, access the CLI by selecting the Cloud Shell icon. Launching Cloud Shell brings up a CLI window in PowerShell or BASH mode. If you’re familiar with PowerShell, you can manage your Azure environment using PowerShell commands.<br><br>Use PowerShell in the CLI<br>Use the PowerShell Get-date command to get the current date and time.<br><br>The Get-date command is a PowerShell specific command. Most Azure specific commands start with the letters az. Let's try an Azure command to check what version of the CLI you're using right now.<br><br>PowerShell<br>az version<br>Use BASH in the CLI<br>If you’re more familiar with BASH, you can use BASH commands instead by shifting to the BASH CLI.<br><br>Enter bash to switch to the BASH CLI.<br><br>Screenshot of the Azure BASH CLI at initial launch.<br><br> Tip<br><br>You can tell you're in BASH mode by the username displayed on the command line, your username@azure.<br><br>Again, use the Get-date command to get the current date and time.<br><br>You received an error because Get-date is a PowerShell specific command.<br><br>Screenshot of BASH error message get-date command not found.<br><br>Use the date command to get the current date and time.<br><br>Just like in the PowerShell mode of the CLI, use the letters az to start an Azure command in the BASH mode. Try to run an update to the CLI with az upgrade.<br><br>You can change back to PowerShell mode by entering pwsh on the BASH command line.<br><br>Use Azure CLI interactive mode<br>Another way to interact is using the Azure CLI interactive mode. This changes CLI behavior to more closely resemble an integrated development environment (IDE). Interactive mode provides autocompletion, command descriptions, and even examples. If you’re unfamiliar with BASH and PowerShell, but want to use the command line, interactive mode may help you.<br><br>Enter az interactive to enter interactive mode.<br><br>Decide whether you wish to send telemetry data and enter YES or NO.<br><br>You may have to wait a minute or two to allow the interactive mode to fully initialize. Then, enter the letter “a” and auto-completion should start to work. If auto-completion isn’t working, wait a bit longer and try again.<br><br>Once initialized, you can use the arrow keys or tab to help complete your commands. Interactive mode is set up specifically for Azure, so you don't need to enter az to start a command. Try the upgrade or version commands again, but this time without az in front.<br><br>The commands should have worked the same as before, and given you the same results. Use the exit command to leave interactive mode.</p><h2><br><strong>Describe Azure physical infrastructure</strong></h2><p><br>Throughout your journey with Microsoft Azure, you’ll hear and use terms like Regions, Availability Zones, Resources, Subscriptions, and more. This module focuses on the core architectural components of Azure. The core architectural components of Azure may be broken down into two main groupings: the physical infrastructure, and the management infrastructure.<br><br>Physical infrastructure<br>The physical infrastructure for Azure starts with datacenters. Conceptually, the datacenters are the same as large corporate datacenters. They’re facilities with resources arranged in racks, with dedicated power, cooling, and networking infrastructure.<br><br>As a global cloud provider, Azure has datacenters around the world. However, these individual datacenters aren’t directly accessible. Datacenters are grouped into Azure Regions or Azure Availability Zones that are designed to help you achieve resiliency and reliability for your business-critical workloads.<br><br>The Global infrastructure site gives you a chance to interactively explore the underlying Azure infrastructure.<br><br>Regions<br>A region is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network. Azure intelligently assigns and controls the resources within each region to ensure workloads are appropriately balanced.<br><br>When you deploy a resource in Azure, you'll often need to choose the region where you want your resource deployed.<br><br> Note<br><br>Some services or virtual machine (VM) features are only available in certain regions, such as specific VM sizes or storage types. There are also some global Azure services that don't require you to select a particular region, such as Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Traffic Manager, and Azure DNS.<br><br>Availability Zones<br>Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. An availability zone is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks.<br><br>Diagram showing three datacenters connected in a single Azure region representing an availability zone.<br><br>To ensure resiliency, a minimum of three separate availability zones are present in all availability zone-enabled regions. However, not all Azure Regions currently support availability zones.</p><h2><br><strong>Use availability zones in your apps</strong></h2><p>You want to ensure your services and data are redundant so you can protect your information in case of failure. When you host your infrastructure, setting up your own redundancy requires that you create duplicate hardware environments. Azure can help make your app highly available through availability zones.<br><br>You can use availability zones to run mission-critical applications and build high-availability into your application architecture by co-locating your compute, storage, networking, and data resources within an availability zone and replicating in other availability zones. Keep in mind that there could be a cost to duplicating your services and transferring data between availability zones.<br><br>Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases. Azure services that support availability zones fall into three categories:<br><br>Zonal services: You pin the resource to a specific zone (for example, VMs, managed disks, IP addresses).<br>Zone-redundant services: The platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone-redundant storage, SQL Database).<br>Non-regional services: Services are always available from Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages as well as region-wide outages.<br>Even with the additional resiliency that availability zones provide, it’s possible that an event could be so large that it impacts multiple availability zones in a single region. To provide even further resilience, Azure has Region Pairs.<br><br>Region pairs<br>Most Azure regions are paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away. This approach allows for the replication of resources across a geography that helps reduce the likelihood of interruptions because of events such as natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages that affect an entire region. For example, if a region in a pair was affected by a natural disaster, services would automatically fail over to the other region in its region pair.<br><br>Not all Azure services automatically replicate data or automatically fall back from a failed region to cross-replicate to another enabled region. In these scenarios, recovery and replication must be configured by the customer.<br><br>Examples of region pairs in Azure are West US paired with East US and South-East Asia paired with East Asia. Because the pair of regions are directly connected and far enough apart to be isolated from regional disasters, you can use them to provide reliable services and data redundancy.<br><br>Diagram showing the relationship between geography, region pair, region, and availability zone.<br><br>Additional advantages of region pairs:<br>If an extensive Azure outage occurs, one region out of every pair is prioritized to make sure at least one is restored as quickly as possible for applications hosted in that region pair.<br>Planned Azure updates are rolled out to paired regions one region at a time to minimize downtime and risk of application outage.<br>Data continues to reside within the same geography as its pair (except for Brazil South) for tax- and law-enforcement jurisdiction purposes.<br> Important<br><br>Most regions are paired in two directions, meaning they are the backup for the region that provides a backup for them (West US and East US back each other up). However, some regions, such as West India and Brazil South, are paired in only one direction. In a one-direction pairing, the Primary region does not provide backup for its secondary region. So, even though West India’s secondary region is South India, South India does not rely on West India. West India's secondary region is South India, but South India's secondary region is Central India. Brazil South is unique because it's paired with a region outside of its geography. Brazil South's secondary region is South Central US. The secondary region of South Central US isn't Brazil South.<br><br>Sovereign Regions<br>In addition to regular regions, Azure also has sovereign regions. Sovereign regions are instances of Azure that are isolated from the main instance of Azure. You may need to use a sovereign region for compliance or legal purposes.<br><br>Azure sovereign regions include:<br><br>US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa and more: These regions are physical and logical network-isolated instances of Azure for U.S. government agencies and partners. These datacenters are operated by screened U.S. personnel and include additional compliance certifications.<br>China East, China North, and more: These regions are available through a unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet, whereby Microsoft doesn't directly maintain the datacenters.<br><br>Describe Azure management infrastructure<br>The management infrastructure includes Azure resources and resource groups, subscriptions, and accounts. Understanding the hierarchical organization will help you plan your projects and products within Azure.<br><br>Azure resources and resource groups<br>A resource is the basic building block of Azure. Anything you create, provision, deploy, etc. is a resource. Virtual Machines (VMs), virtual networks, databases, cognitive services, etc. are all considered resources within Azure.<br><br>Diagram showing a resource group box with a function, VM, database, and app included.<br><br>Resource groups are simply groupings of resources. When you create a resource, you’re required to place it into a resource group. While a resource group can contain many resources, a single resource can only be in one resource group at a time. Some resources may be moved between resource groups, but when you move a resource to a new group, it will no longer be associated with the former group. Additionally, resource groups can't be nested, meaning you can’t put resource group B inside of resource group A.<br><br>Resource groups provide a convenient way to group resources together. When you apply an action to a resource group, that action will apply to all the resources within the resource group. If you delete a resource group, all the resources will be deleted. If you grant or deny access to a resource group, you’ve granted or denied access to all the resources within the resource group.<br><br>When you’re provisioning resources, it’s good to think about the resource group structure that best suits your needs.<br><br>For example, if you’re setting up a temporary dev environment, grouping all the resources together means you can deprovision all of the associated resources at once by deleting the resource group. If you’re provisioning compute resources that will need three different access schemas, it may be best to group resources based on the access schema, and then assign access at the resource group level.<br><br>There aren’t hard rules about how you use resource groups, so consider how to set up your resource groups to maximize their usefulness for you.</p><h2><br><strong>Azure subscriptions</strong></h2><p>In Azure, subscriptions are a unit of management, billing, and scale. Similar to how resource groups are a way to logically organize resources, subscriptions allow you to logically organize your resource groups and facilitate billing.<br><br>Diagram showing Azure subscriptions using authentication and authorization to access Azure accounts.<br><br>Using Azure requires an Azure subscription. A subscription provides you with authenticated and authorized access to Azure products and services. It also allows you to provision resources. An Azure subscription links to an Azure account, which is an identity in Microsoft Entra ID or in a directory that Microsoft Entra ID trusts.<br><br>An account can have multiple subscriptions, but it’s only required to have one. In a multi-subscription account, you can use the subscriptions to configure different billing models and apply different access-management policies. You can use Azure subscriptions to define boundaries around Azure products, services, and resources. There are two types of subscription boundaries that you can use:<br><br>Billing boundary: This subscription type determines how an Azure account is billed for using Azure. You can create multiple subscriptions for different types of billing requirements. Azure generates separate billing reports and invoices for each subscription so that you can organize and manage costs.<br>Access control boundary: Azure applies access-management policies at the subscription level, and you can create separate subscriptions to reflect different organizational structures. An example is that within a business, you have different departments to which you apply distinct Azure subscription policies. This billing model allows you to manage and control access to the resources that users provision with specific subscriptions.<br>Create additional Azure subscriptions<br>Similar to using resource groups to separate resources by function or access, you might want to create additional subscriptions for resource or billing management purposes. For example, you might choose to create additional subscriptions to separate:<br><br>Environments: You can choose to create subscriptions to set up separate environments for development and testing, security, or to isolate data for compliance reasons. This design is particularly useful because resource access control occurs at the subscription level.<br>Organizational structures: You can create subscriptions to reflect different organizational structures. For example, you could limit one team to lower-cost resources, while allowing the IT department a full range. This design allows you to manage and control access to the resources that users provision within each subscription.<br>Billing: You can create additional subscriptions for billing purposes. Because costs are first aggregated at the subscription level, you might want to create subscriptions to manage and track costs based on your needs. For instance, you might want to create one subscription for your production workloads and another subscription for your development and testing workloads.<br>Azure management groups<br>The final piece is the management group. Resources are gathered into resource groups, and resource groups are gathered into subscriptions. If you’re just starting in Azure that might seem like enough hierarchy to keep things organized. But imagine if you’re dealing with multiple applications, multiple development teams, in multiple geographies.<br><br>If you have many subscriptions, you might need a way to efficiently manage access, policies, and compliance for those subscriptions. Azure management groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions. You organize subscriptions into containers called management groups and apply governance conditions to the management groups. All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group, the same way that resource groups inherit settings from subscriptions and resources inherit from resource groups. Management groups give you enterprise-grade management at a large scale, no matter what type of subscriptions you might have. Management groups can be nested.<br><br>Management group, subscriptions, and resource group hierarchy<br>You can build a flexible structure of management groups and subscriptions to organize your resources into a hierarchy for unified policy and access management. The following diagram shows an example of creating a hierarchy for governance by using management groups.<br><br>Diagram showing an example of a management group hierarchy tree.<br><br>Some examples of how you could use management groups might be:<br><br>Create a hierarchy that applies a policy. You could limit VM locations to the US West Region in a group called Production. This policy will inherit onto all the subscriptions that are descendants of that management group and will apply to all VMs under those subscriptions. This security policy can't be altered by the resource or subscription owner, which allows for improved governance.<br>Provide user access to multiple subscriptions. By moving multiple subscriptions under a management group, you can create one Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) assignment on the management group. Assigning Azure RBAC at the management group level means that all sub-management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources underneath that management group would also inherit those permissions. One assignment on the management group can enable users to have access to everything they need instead of scripting Azure RBAC over different subscriptions.<br>Important facts about management groups:<br><br>10,000 management groups can be supported in a single directory.<br>A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth. This limit doesn't include the root level or the subscription level.<br>Each management group and subscription can support only one parent.<br><br>You have the opportunity to create a resource group when you create the virtual machine. If you name the resource group the same as the recommended name, it makes clean-up easier at the end of the exercise.<br><br>Task 1: Create a virtual machine<br>In this task, you’ll create a virtual machine using the Azure portal.<br><br>Sign in to the Azure portal.<br><br>Select Create a resource &gt; Compute &gt; Virtual Machine &gt; Create.<br><br>The Create a virtual machine pane opens to the basics tab.<br><br>Verify or enter the following values for each setting. If a setting isn’t specified, leave the default value.</p><p><br>Product details will include a cost associated with creating the virtual machine. This is a system function. If you’re creating the VM in the Learn sandbox, you won’t actually incur any costs.<br><br>Select Create<br>Wait while the VM is provisioned. Deployment is in progress will change to Deployment is complete when the VM is ready.<br><br>Task 2: Verify resources created<br>Once the deployment is created, you can verify that Azure created not only a VM, but all of the associated resources the VM needs.<br><br>Select Home.<br>Under Azure services, select Resource groups.<br>Select the IntroAzureRG resource group.<br>You should see a list of resources in the resource group. The resources were created when you created the virtual machine. By default, Azure gave them all a similar name to help with association and grouped them in the same resource group.<br><br>Congratulations! You've created a resource in Azure and had a chance to see how resources get grouped on creation.</p><h2><br><strong>Clean up</strong></h2><p>To clean up the assets created in this exercise and avoid unnecessary costs, delete the resource group (and all associated resources).<br><br>From the Azure home page, under Azure servces, select Resource groups.<br>Select the IntroAzureRG resource group.<br>Select Delete resource group.<br>Enter IntroAzureRG to confirm deletion of the resource group and select delete.<br><br><br></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on December 1, 2025</p><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fgetting-started-with-azure-cloud.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fgetting-started-with-azure-cloud.html&amp;via=_Aindien&amp;text=Getting%20Started%20with%20Azure%20Cloud" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://aindien.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://aindien.com/powershell-for-windows-server.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Powershell for Windows Server</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-10-24T22:21" class="feed__date">October 24, 2025</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/windows-10-autopilot-and-azure.html" class="invert">Windows 10, Autopilot, &amp; Azure</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-10-09T20:26" class="feed__date">October 9, 2025</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/excel-365-working-with-charts-and-sparklines.html" class="invert">Excel 365: Working With Charts &amp; Sparklines</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-10-09T19:55" class="feed__date">October 9, 2025</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/working-with-power-supplies.html" class="invert">Working with Power Supplies</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><style type="text/css">#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }
