Well-designed regulation can improve societal outcomes but poorly designed regulation stifles economic efficiency. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the US, governments tax citizens to correct market failures and externalities, raise revenues, redistribute funds, and finance operations. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through direct regulation and price controls, governments can intervene to influence market outcomes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although government intervention sometimes creates inefficiencies, it often results in improving social well being.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weighing the trade-offs between equity and efficiency is one task of an economist.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is up to each individual to decide when and where government intervention makes the most sense. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When government tax revenues fall below spending. The government runs a budget deficit. When the converse happens and tax revenues exceed spending, the government is running a budget surplus. Total government spending and tax revenues have increased over the past several decades. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The largest component of federal government revenues comes from the individual income tax, followed by social insurance tax receipts. Corporate income tax, excise taxes, and other sources of income make up a smaller percentage of federal receipts.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual income taxes represent the largest portion, around 47% in 2013.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payroll taxes represent about a third of the federal government’s receipts. A payroll tax, also known as social insurance tax, is a tax on your wages that employers are required to withhold from employees’ pay. On your paystub, these are often listed as Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or FICA taxes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corporate income tax provides 10 percent of the overall pie. Corporate income tax is generated from taxing profits earned by corporations.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All other taxes make up the remaining 9 percent. This includes excise taxes, which are taxes paid when purchasing specific goods such as alcohol, tobacco, and gasoline.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State and local governments receive a much smaller fraction of their tax revenues from individual incomes taxes than does the federal government. Instead, property taxes, income taxes, and transfers from the federal government account for the bulk of their revenues.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four main factors influence government taxation and spending decisions:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raising revenues</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redistributing funds via transfer payments</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financing operations</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Correcting market failures and externalities</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most taxation in our economy is intended to raise revenues for the funding of public goods such as national defense, public education, police protection, and infrastructure projects. The federal government spends most of its money on national defense and social security. The two biggest items of spending for state governments are education and public welfare. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second major objective of government taxation and spending is redistribution. Market outcomes can be quite inequitable, with high levels of inequality and poverty coexisting alongside huge fortunes for a few. Governments in all advanced economies use transfer payments and the tax system to limit the extent of such inequality and the economic hardships that poorer households in the society suffer.  Transfer payments refer to payments from the government to certain groups, such as the elderly or the unemployed. Social security is the largest transfer program and was introduced by Roosevelt in 1935 to provide economic security to the elderly, disabled, widows, and fatherless children. Medicare, introduced by Lynbdon Johnson in 1965, provides health insurance to Americans aged 65 and older and makes up another l;arge part of federal spending. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public welfare makes up a significant part of state and local budgets. This consists of transfer and vendor payments made to private purveyors for medical, burials, and other services provided under welfare programs.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A progressive tax system is one in which tax rates increase with taxable base incomes, so that the rich pay higher tax rates than the less well to do. To understand this system more precisely, we need to distinguish between average and marginal tax rates. The average tax rate faced by a household is the total tax paid divided by total income earned. The marginal tax rate refers to how much of the last dollar earned the household pays in taxes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The alternatives to the progressive tax system are the proportional and regressive tax systems. In a proportional tax system, households pay the same percentage of their incomes in taxes regardless of their income level. In a regressive tax system, the marginal tax and average tax rates decline with income so that low income households pay a greater percentage of income in taxes than do high income households. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of transfer programs and progressive taxation, the post tax income distribution in the US is more equal than the pre tax income distribution. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governments also tax to pay for their own operations, including the salaries of presidents, members of congress, and other politicians, and for the sizable bureaucracy in charge of the day to day running of government operations and services. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government sometimes imposes taxes to correct market failures or externalities. Though important in principle, this use of taxation is far less prevalent than the three reasons discussed above.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term tax incidence refers to how the burden of the tax is distributed across various agents in the economy. The incidence on producers is the portion of tax revenue that lies above the pre-tax equilibrium price, is given by the same green triangle. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadweight loss of taxation is the loss in total surplus or the decline in consumer and producer surpluses not made up by the increase in tax revenues. The deadweight losses of taxation imply that for every dollar of tax raised, the cost is greater than a dollar. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In competitive markets, tax incidence and equilibrium prices and quantities are independent of whether the tax is imposed on consumers or producers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that the incidence of the tax is identical for buyers and sellers in the examples above is due to how we drew the market demand and market supply curves. So, that means buyers and sellers are equally sensitive to price changes at the original equilibrium. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Externalities and various market failures can have significant social costs. The main tool that governments use to deal with externalities and other sources of market failures is regulation. Regulation refers to actions by the federal or local government directed at influencing market outcomes, such as the quantity traded of a good or service, its price, or its quality of safety. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common form of government intervention in markets is direct regulation. Direct regulation refers to direct actions by the government to control the amount of a certain activity. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A price ceiling is a cap on the price of a market good or service. One important example is rent control. A price ceiling causes a shortage.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes the government steps in to impose a minimum price on a  product or service. The result is a price floor, which represents a lower limit on the price of the product or service. A good example of a price floor is the minimum wage.  A price floor causes a surplus. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every government program needs bureaucrats to monitor its implementation and these people have to be paid. However, they are taken out of productive sectors of the economy. In this way, the allocation of time and talent of individuals to bureaucracy is an important cost of government. This cost is increased by the fact that bureaucracies don’t function efficiently. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equally as important as the deadweight losses associated with government intervention and the inefficiencies of bureaucracies is the corruption that large governments engender. Corruption refers to the misuse of public funds or the distortion of the allocation of resources for personal gain. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The underground economy, or black market, includes activities where income taxes are not paid, as well as illegal activities such as drug dealing and prostitution. In modern economies, black markets cover an array of activities and are generally found in areas where the benefits of such activities are the highest. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problems of an underground economy are:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it involves goods and services that have been legally banned, the underground economy undermines the ban.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When underground transactions occur in markets for legal goods and services in order to avoid taxes or regulation, they put legitimate businesses at a disadvantage. </span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To compensate for the lost revenue, governments must levy higher taxes</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criminals spend vast resources trying to evade the law, which are not effective uses of society’s resources.</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The equity-efficiency-trade-off refers to the balance between ensuring an equitable allocation of resources and increasing social surplus or total output. Most would agree that equity and efficiency are the two most important goals for government policy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trade-off between equity and efficiency represents the nub of the conflict between those who support big government and those who call for smaller government. The government can often achieve greater social equality but only at the expense of greater inefficiencies. When social inequality is very high, there may be no conflict between equity and efficiency. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equity and efficiency are two opposites. To have one means you lose the other. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All developed nations seek to achieve some degree of equality in their society. The welfare state refers to the set of insurance, regulation, and transfer programs utilized to create a safety net, reduce poverty, and redistribute income from the rich to the poor. The welfare state is even more expansive in Europe. Despite deadweight losses associated with their systems, many European nations choose to promote some degree of equality in income. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer sovereignty is the view that choices made by a consumer reflect his or her true preferences, and outsiders, including the government, should not interfere with these choices. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the other end of the spectrum is paternalism. Paternalism is the view that consumers do not always know what is best for them, and the government should encourage or induce them to change their actions. This approach gives the government an active hand in designing choices to help individuals make the right decision. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The social security system in the US, which forces individuals to save for old age, was born out of paternalism. Laws that ban substance abuse are also motivated by paternalism. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we have shown, a major efficiency loss of taxation is deadweight loss. So, the debate on the reach of the government should hinge on the effect of its actions, the larger the deadweight loss, the worse the policy.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The government typically operates in a slow moving manner. A significant drag on the economy can result if regulators cannot move swiftly in response to changing market conditions. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governments can play an important role in ensuring that markets are competitive, efficient, and equitable. Key roles of the government include taxation to raise funds to provide public goods, such as national defense, policing, and infrastructure investments that would not be provided adequately by the market. The use of tax and transfer programs to achieve a more equitable distribution of resources in society and the use of taxes and subsidies as well as regulation to correct market failures. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The costs of government interventions must be compared carefully with their benefits. Economics is most useful not as a value judgment on whether the government is good or bad, but for understanding what sorts of activities require government intervention. </span></p><p><br><br><br></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary types of tax systems are:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressive</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proportional</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regressive</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of a progressive tax is the:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Income tax</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of a regressive tax is the:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social security tax</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of a proportional tax is the:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicare tax</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax incidence refers to:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who bears the burden of a tax</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the entire burden of the tax always borne by those on whom is is imposed?:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not necessarily, since the burden of the tax depends on price elasticity.
