Running a restore is one of the quickest ways to get running again. Do this with the <code>rstrui</code> tool built into the operating system. Running the system file checker is a good option next and is done so using the &lt;cmd&gt; tool with the <code>sfc /scannow</code> command. Always remove unwanted programs and keep an eye on this list in case rogue programs appear. You should routinely scan for malware too using whatever antivirus program you have access to. If your computer will not boot then use the Windows startup repair tool. It will scan for issues and try to repair them. Update Windows on a regular<br>basis as this prevents a lot of problems from happening in the first place. Use the printer management tool to help diagnose and prevent printer issues. This lets you see the driver that is installed and update it often. To make it easier to update multiple machines, use Powershell and write a script to download Windows updates and<br>install them. This same process can be used for many of the apps and browsers that you use also. Lastly, use the computer management tools to monitor and investigate any issues that users experience.</p><p><br><span style="color: #2dc26b;"><strong>Network Troubleshooting:</strong></span></p><p>The first thing to do is gather information about what is happening and try to duplicate the problem. Determine if you have a system outage or something local to this machine, like a missing cable. Once you determine that you need to do troubleshooting, the quickest way is to use the command line. There are several command line utilities built into every operating system. Windows is no exception. Try to ping an outside location relative to your network. If this does not work, then try pinging something inside the network. These two steps will give you a lot of information. Use the <code>tracert</code> utility next to see the route that traffic takes. This will tell you if a switch is down, for example. Another tool to try is <code>nslookup</code>. This tells you if your internal DNS is working correctly. For example, you may not be able to access a machine’s name but can use its IP address and is a clear sign of a DNS error or a misconfiguration. Finally, use <code>ipconfig</code> to see how your network is configured. It can give a lot of information and give you vital clues. </p><p><br><span style="color: #2dc26b;"><strong>Browser Troubleshooting:</strong></span></p><p>Browsers are the new client. Almost everything can run in them so it is important to know how to troubleshoot and prevent problems. When you have trouble with them make sure to update to the current version, remove unwanted extensions, clear your cache, reinstall your browser, and delete your browser history.</p><p><br><span style="color: #2dc26b;"><strong>Linux Troubleshooting:</strong></span></p><p>The first thing to do is look at the documentation to see if there have been any recent system changes. If there have been changes, they will give you a clue on where to start looking. This is a vital step. Confirm that all of your systems are updated. Whether server or client side, almost everything should be updated often. Monitor your hardware all the time. Your hardware is the CPU, Network, Memory, and Disks. Reboot occasionally. Though Linux will need to be rebooted less than Windows, it should still be done every now and then. Use the <code>top</code> utility to look for CPU issues and processes that might be causing them. Watch your memory usage. In particular, watch for anything using a large amount of memory. You should know what is running on your systems and how much memory is typically used at certain times of the day. Make reports and compare different time periods. To do this, start with the <code>free -m</code> command within a terminal. Disks need to be monitored on a regular basis too. How often you monitor depends on the workload and importance of it. I will say, however, that it is very easy and quick to watch your hardware, so you should do it often regardless. Watch your disk stats with the <code>df -h</code> command from the terminal. This gives you a quick snapshot of what is going on with any disk. Network problems because of hardware are more rare but happen too. Cables get pinched or eaten. Network interface cards can go bad. A port on a switch can also be the culprit.</p><p><span style="color: #2dc26b;"><strong>Microsoft Office365:</strong></span></p><p>I am proficient in using and supporting Office365 including Outlook, Excel, and Teams. I have written many support guides in response to staff problems and questions. I have experience troubleshooting Office365 issues and using its admin portal to reset passwords, adjust group memberships in Active Directory, and add/remove licenses. I used Exchange Online to do message traces and block spam constantly.</p><p><br><span style="color: #2dc26b;"><strong>Outlook Troubleshooting:</strong></span></p><p>I know how to use and support this mail client. Examples include archiving mail, automatic reply, scheduling emails, sharing calendars, and creating mailing lists. I setup new Outlook profiles for people with particularly sticky issues. Showing people how to encrypt email is also important. One of the issues that pops up from time to time is having to fix the &lt;.ost&gt; and &lt;.pst&gt; files. If you need to repair these files, use the &lt;scanpst.exe&gt; binary in the Microsoft Office program folder. Sometimes it is hard to identify the cause of an issue and you just want to create a new Outlook profile. This is a good step and do it by going to the &lt;Mail&gt; settings, then &lt;Show Profiles&gt; and then &lt;Add&gt;. Give your new profile a name and select to use this all the time. Another annoying issue is when Outlook continually prompts for a password. If this happens to you, go to &lt;control panel&gt;, &lt;mail&gt;, and &lt;edit&gt; your Outlook profile. Select the box to &lt;remember my credentials&gt;.</p><p><br><span style="color: #2dc26b;"><strong>Git:</strong></span></p><p>I use Git for my code and documentation. I write guides a lot and program as a hobby so Git is very useful for versioning and backup. I am competent creating repositories, using the standard Git workflow and pushing my work to an online repository.</p><h3><br><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Websites:</strong></span></h3><p>I write on Aindien.com and Sciencebyjason.com regularly.
