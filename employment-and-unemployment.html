The value of the marginal product of labor is also the labor demand curve because they both show how the quantity of labor demanded varies with the wage.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The labor supply curve represents the relationship between the quantity of labor supplied and the wage.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The competitive equilibrium wage is the market clearing wage. At this wage, every worker who wants a job can find one: the quantity of labor demanded matches the quantity of labor supplied.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Job search refers to the activities that workers undertake to find appropriate jobs.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frictional unemployment refers to the unemployment that arises because workers have imperfect information about available jobs and need to engage in a time consuming process of job search.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wage rigidity refers to the condition in which the market wage is held above the competitive equilibrium level that would clear the labor market.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structural unemployment arises when the quantity of labor supplied persistently exceeds the quantity of labor demanded. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collective bargaining refers to the contract between firms and labor unions.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efficiency wages are wages above the lowest pay that workers would accept: employers use them to increase motivation and productivity. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downward wage rigidity arises when workers resist a cut in their wage and firms respond to this resistance by holding nominal wages fixed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The natural rate of unemployment is the rate of unemployment around which a healthy economy fluctuates.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long run rate of unemployment is the average historical rate of unemployment.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyclical unemployment is the deviation of the actual unemployment rate from the long run rate of unemployment.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potential workers are defined as the civilian non-institutional population ages 16 and older. Those holding a paid full time or part time job are classified as employed, while those without a paid job who have actively looked for work are unemployed. Potential workers who are employed and unemployed make up the labor force, while the rest of the potential workers are classified as out of the labor force. The unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unemployment rate fluctuates significantly over time. It is higher during and in the immediate aftermath of recessions.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employment is determined by labor demand and labor supply. The labor demand curve is downward-sloping because of the diminishing marginal product of labor and profit maximization by firms. In contrast, the labor supply curve tends to be upward-sloping because higher wages generally encourage workers to supply even more hours to the labor market.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The competitive labor market equilibrium is given by the intersection of the labor demand and labor supply curves. The competitive equilibrium wage is also called the market clearing wage.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a competitive labor market equilibrium in which all workers know the market clearing wage, there will be very little unemployment because every worker willing to work at the market clearing wage can find a job. Workers who are not willing to work at the market clearing wage will stop searching and will therefore not be counted as unemployed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frictional unemployment exists because workers need time to learn about the condition of the labrador market, and search for a job that suits them. Even in a healthy labor market, there will always be some unemployed workers in the process of changing jobs, or finding a new job after losing their previous one, or finding their first job after entry into the labor market.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Structural unemployment results when the market wage is above the market clearing level, causing the quantity of labor supplied to be greater than the quantity of labor demanded. This is often referred to as wage rigidity. It can result from institutional features of the labor market like minimum wage legislation or collective bargaining. More importantly, it can result from efficiency wages or from downward wage rigidity. Efficiency wages arise when employers pay wages higher than the market clearing wage to increase worker productivity. Downward wage rigidity arises because of the unwillingness of workers to accept wage cuts, which prevents wages from immediately falling in response to a leftward shift of the labor demand curve.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important cause of unemployment fluctuations is a shifting labor demand curve. When wages are flexible, a shift to the left of the labor demand curve reduces both employment and wages but does not increase unemployment because the labor market clears. When wages are rigid, the same leftward shift creates a larger decline in employment because the wage does not decline and unemployment increases.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The natural state of unemployment is the rate of unemployment around which a healthy economy fluctuates. The long run rate of unemployment is the average historical rate of unemployment, which tends to be higher than the natural rate of unemployment due to the presence of structural unemployment. Cyclical unemployment is the difference between the current rate of unemployment and the long run rate of unemployment. Cyclical unemployment is positive in recessions and negative in economic booms. </span></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 7, 2023</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://aindien.com/economics/">Economics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Femployment-and-unemployment.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Femployment-and-unemployment.html&amp;via=_Aindien&amp;text=Employment%20and%20Unemployment" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://aindien.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://aindien.com/why-some-countries-are-poorer-than-others.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Why Some Countries Are Poorer Than Others</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://aindien.com/credit-markets-in-economics.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Credit Markets In Economics </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><style type="text/css">#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }
