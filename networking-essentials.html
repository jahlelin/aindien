There are computer networks everywhere these days. From the business to our homes, local area networks and wireless systems are common and easy to create. What happens though when you want to connect 2 or more local area networks together? Well it gets really interesting then. Most organizations aspire to grow. When an organization or business grows they will need to connect remote offices. Connecting your lans together or just adding wireless in a wide area network is the natural evolution of scaling your infrastructure.</div><div> </div><div> </div><div></div><div> </div><div> </div><div><h3 style="text-align: center;">Scaling Your Network</h3><p>The purpose of scaling your network is allowing it to grow. Rarely do networks need to remain their original size. Over time you need to add more <a href="https://aindien.com/computer-networking-devices.html">devices</a>, rooms of equipment, or possibly even another location. This applies to both homes and businesses so it is equally applicable.</p><figure class="size-full wp-image-60 aligncenter"><img class="lazyload" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/scale_network2.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network2-xs.png 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network2-sm.png 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network2-md.png 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network2-lg.png 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network2-xl.png 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network2-2xl.png 1600w" alt="scaling your network" data-aspectratio="1.413098" width="561" height="397"></figure><p> </p><p>You have hooked a few computers together through a switch. Then you added a <a href="https://aindien.com/network-basics-easy-addressing-and-routing.html">router</a> to get to the internet. So you have a nice shiny new network. This could be at home or a small business. What now? How do you make it even more useful? How do you get it to the size you need? These are all questions I hope to answer.</p></div><h2> <strong>Scaling your Network : Budgeting</strong></h2><p>This is one of the key points. you just have to budget for updated equipment and software these days. Figure out what you can do and set it aside at some regular interval. Even if you do not use that money every interval at least let it grow so you can be saving for that new switch or backup router. You don't want your only router to go down and not have a replacement ready.</p><p>The same goes for software considerations. Occasionally everything just needs to be updated. Whether no one develops for it anymore or it just stops getting security patches, you need to be ready to move on if it does not meet your needs anymore. The only way to do this is to have a budget for a replacement when you get the idea it will need to be replaced soon.</p><p> </p><div><h3 style="text-align: center;">Scaling Your Network : Understanding Its Characteristics</h3><p>Understanding what your network consists of is key to planning for future growth and budgeting. You could have a small network with only a single server to multiple locations and a hundred servers. Whatever it is, you need to know what all is involved and a little bit of how it works.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"> </h3><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Local Area Network</strong></h3><figure class="size-full wp-image-61 aligncenter"><img class="lazyload" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/scale_network3.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network3-xs.png 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network3-sm.png 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network3-md.png 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network3-lg.png 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network3-xl.png 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network3-2xl.png 1600w" alt="scaling your network" data-aspectratio="1.413098" width="561" height="397"></figure><p> </p><p>Local area networks are made up of switches, routers, cables, computers and information. Switches have less capabilities than routers but will send traffic to different areas. Routers are quite intelligent these days. Expanding your lan is the usual way you will start scaling your network to make it larger and more useful.</p><p>They are smart and will route traffic to different areas as well as decide what is the best route. They also will make sure your traffic gets through if part of your network goes down. Information, or data, is the key thing here.</p><p>Most people do not think about this at all. Your entire reason for having a network is the storage and manipulation of data. Your network is information. It does not matter whether you analyze spreadsheets all day, code your new cloud software or play games, you still have information that needs to move around on the network.</p></div><div> </div><div>It does not matter the location either. Your network can be at home or the office or in another <a href="https://aindien.com/what-cloud-computing-really-means.html">country</a>. One local area network will at least be similar to another.  They will include workstations that people use to do things for fun or work.</div><div> </div><div>A server may or may not actually be in a local area network like this. If it does, though, it will provide services like file storage or printing over the network.</div><div> </div><div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Wide Area Network</strong></h3></div><div> </div><div>So what is missing is something to link these local area networks together into a larger network which is called a wide area <a href="https://aindien.com/network-management-guide.html">network</a>. Connecting your lans together in a wide area network is what cities and large businesses do when they need to connect their offices and share data. Price and know how has always been the limiting factors here. Scaling your network at this level is not the easiest thing to do.</div><div> </div><div>The price can be rather expensive. It is usually not for the home user. This is for large businesses or organizations with a lot of resources. The technical knowledge required to implement a solution like this is not for the average hobbyist either. It can get quite complicated. There are many technologies at play here and they all have their quirks. Getting them to work right is often times a pain.</div><div> </div><div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Digital Routers</strong></h3><figure class="size-full wp-image-62 aligncenter"><img class="lazyload" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/scale_network4.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network4-xs.png 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network4-sm.png 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network4-md.png 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network4-lg.png 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network4-xl.png 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network4-2xl.png 1600w" alt="scaling your network" data-aspectratio="1.413098" width="561" height="397"></figure></div><div> </div><div>These are called digital routers. They link local area networks together. The following link is the kind of router I am talking about. As your computer must interface to the network, so must your network connect likewise to this special router that provides, of course, routing services for your local area network. These routers are more expensive than your usual home router. They are quite special and even many businesses will not use these.</div><div> </div><div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Fixed Line Services</strong></h3></div><div> </div><div>These days though, many people do not need to worry about all the details of how things work. They can still get the same services without worrying about the technicalities. The reason is that they can get and then pay for fixed lines that do the hard work for them. Many companies now offer this service. This is where they come out and install the infrastructure and then either you or them can manage things for you.</div><div> </div><div> </div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Scaling Your Network : Technologies Used In A Wan</strong></h3><p>If you have a larger network then you undoubtedly use 1 or more of the following technologies. Businesses often use a mix or older and newer technology. Since this is a more complicated routine than setting up a small house hold network, there are several technologies used to integrate everything together. Some of these are ATM, Frame Relay, SONET, and X.25. Some of these are very old but there are several companies that still use them. Communication using one of these protocols is essential in scaling your network in order for it to connect to other networks.</p><div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>ATM</strong></h3><p>ATM stands for asynchronous transfer mode. It is one of the more current technologies and still used a lot by equipment.  It is a digital system unlike the old telephone system that was once used. Speeds obtained from ATM are limited mostly by the media and and your cash. Fiber optics will be your best media here.</p><p>The protocol used in ATM to get all this done is call cell switching. These are very tiny packets and are called cell switching. They are called this because the packets are so small. It is very fast too. It is able to reach speeds of 10 gbps.</p></div><div> </div><div>Atm is characterized by its type of connections. There are point to point and point to multi-point connections. Point to point is when packets get broadcasted continually until they reach their destination. Point to multi-point is just what it sounds like. One node broadcasts several sets of packets to several  destinations at once.</div><div> </div><div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>SONET</strong></h3><p>This is the synchronous optical network.  It is used a lot these days for WAN connectivity and can also be used in digital technology since fiber is used with it extensively. Being very popular for very large areas, it is very versatile in what it can do. SONET can transfer and carry almost any kind of data.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>X.25</strong></h3></div><div> </div><div>X.25 is an old but still sometimes used technology for packet switching. It is analog and kind of slow by today's standards. It is consistent and reliable though which was one of its better features. Also it was used mainly for simple devices that did not need much speed.</div><div> </div><div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Frame Relay</strong></h3><p>This technology is like X.25 but is digital. It is still used but near as much as it used to be.  Being faster than X.25 though  makes it a great alternative. Performance in your usual environment makes good use of your existing bandwidth.</p></div><p> </p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Scaling Your Network : Choosing Vendors</h3><p>The equipment and software that you buy on a regular basis is vital to your success. If you buy hard drives because they are cheap then either your customers or your staff will be disappointed. That will not be good for your business. Stability is very important in this regard. Use a quality vendor that sells solid infrastructure.</p><p>You also want a vendor that is just a little larger than you are. That is the best recipe for your business. The reason why is that they will be close enough in size to understand what you need. However, since they are a bit larger than you, you can take advantage of their better pricing.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Increasing Your Storage</strong></h3><p>Sometimes to grow your network you will need to first increase your storage capabilities. This can happen in many ways and no two situations are identical. This means that you will need to evaluate what makes sense for your situation and budget. Adding some direct attached storage is an easy and quick way if you have a very small network. Choosing network attached storage is the next step and is typical of a large home network or still a small business setting. A SAN(storage area network) is popular for businesses that can afford them. Don't fall into the trap of getting more than you need even if you can afford it. You should only get the technology that makes sense for you. For example, getting a SAN dramatically increases the complexity of your storage and is a lot more expensive than plain network attached storage. I am just saying be careful is all.</p><div><h3 style="text-align: center;"> </h3></div><div> </div><div>Connecting your <a href="https://aindien.com/aindiens-guide-to-network-communications.html">lans together</a> in a wide area network has many advantages. It can bring together your remote offices, simplify your software needs and centralize your main server infrastructure. Implementing a Wan or any of its technologies is very expensive and complicated though. That is usually why only large organizations or large businesses do this at all. The newer Cloud technologies aim to improve this by making things steadily cheaper. Hopefully it will succeed in doing that.</div><div> </div><div><p>Networking is a popular topic. Microsoft has extensive needs in their systems. Cisco certifications are always highly sought after. It only helps your career if you have knowledge of networking basics.  It is how we play our lan games and how our phones communicate also. Being a very popular subject because of Cisco jobs and equipment especially, I wanted to start a series to address it. At the most fundamental level you have the different topologies. Networking topology, at its core, describes in a high level view how a network is set up. There are many different kinds of topologies such as Ethernet, bus, ring, star and some other obscure ones. In actuality though, Ethernet is the only one worth talking about these days as most of the others have fallen out of use.</p><p> </p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Networking Basics</strong></h3><p>Before I go any farther I need to cover a few basics. This will be at a real high level but I will expand this as time goes on. To make a network you need a few pieces of correct and compatible hardware.</p><ol><li><span style="color: #008000;">Computer</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">Network Card</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">Cabling</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">Wireless Networking</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">Router/Switch</span></li></ol><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Computer</strong></h3><p>The computer can be just about anything from a small netbook to a powerful workstation. Having them roughly the same type will help though. They will all need network cards. These cards are usually PCI based and do the communications with the network. Computers and workstations can have more than one network card in them now too. Cabling also has several options. The most common is category-5 cable but category-6 is making headway and superior. The cables will connect to the router or switch, depending on where it is in the chain of devices.</p><p>It will not matter if the computer is a Mac, Windows, and Linux machine. They will all have a network card these days where you can plug an ethernet cable into.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Network Card</strong></h3><p>Network cards do the communicating with the network. Your cabling plugs into them. There are many standards today which govern their usage. There are so many because they describe the types of cable used, distances involved and other such things that do not matter to most people. The most important thing is the speed which is usually of the gigabit variety. There are many reliable vendors today that make network cards. Many kinds of devices these days can be networked. They include computers, printers, scanners, thermostats, cameras, doorbells, and even sound systems. Network cards often have indicator lights on them so it is easy to see the status of that particular connection.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;">Cabling</h3><p>Ethernet technology is by far the most prevalent type of cabling in the networking world today. You will actually have a hard time finding anything else. The main reason for this is cost as equipment and cabling are key factors and the speeds reachable by it. It is a protocol. That means it has the rules that the devices try to follow.</p><p>Category 5 cable is the most used cabling because there is so much of it out there. It is good and works with anything. Category 6 cable is what you should buy if you have newer equipment as it is superior to older cable types.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #008000;">RJ11 - this is the old telephone connector but is also used for broadband connections.</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">RJ45 - this is the connector for Ethernet cabling.</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">RJ48 - connector used for T1 and ISDN connections.</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">DB-9 - used for RS232 serial connections which is used for management</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">DB-25 - older parallel printer type connection.</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">BNC - good connector used in both IT and AV industries.</span></li></ul><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Twisted Pair Cabling</strong></h3><p>The ISO/IEC 11801 standard governs how twisted pair cabling is used. One type is of course Catergory 5 cabling which can be either 100 mbit Ethernet or 1000mbit Ethernet. You would have to have a compatible network card that used one or both of those speeds. The current version is category 6 cabling and it is even faster at theoretical speeds of 10 gbit. Twisted pair cabling is then divided up into UTP (unshielded twisted pair) and STP ( shielded twisted pair).</p><ul><li><span style="color: #008000;">Unshielded Twisted Pair - made of insulated copper wires that have been twisted around each other to form wire pairs.</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">Shielded Twisted Pair - shielded twisted pair cable is used where there is a lot of inteference such as around power wires.</span></li></ul><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Wireless Networking</strong></h3><p>Wireless networking is the other technology used today and it is used by everyone. It exists along and works with Ethernet networks greatly and is a core component of all networks today. It has standards associated with it also which mostly designate speed differences but also how it works. Examples of standards are a,b, g,n, and the current one today, the AC standard. AC is currently the fastest of the ones in major use today but there are more improvements and thus more standards out there but they are not in common use yet.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Router/Switch/Access Point</strong></h3><p>Most people are aware of the common router you can buy at consumer electronics stores. These are actually access points equipped with routing functionality. They use radio waves to communicate with the network card in your laptop or another access point when you want to extend the distance of your wireless network.</p><p>Wireless networks are governed by the IEEE 802.11 standards. Access points are used to provide a hot spot for wireless clients in the vicinity. Wireless networks operate as a hub and spoke topology. They also are shared and use CSMA/CA.</p><p>Routers will often have a small built in firewall to help with security. There are numerous types of functionality that can be built into these pieces of equipment. I cover many of these in other articles. One important thing to remember is that routers are usually at the edge of your network.</p><p>Switches are usually connected to the router at some point and help segment your network. You will want this if you have multiple buildings or areas with computing equipment in them. These can be small 4 port devices to larger 48 port devices. Switches can also be un-managed or managed network devices.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Routers and Access Points</strong></h3><p>Access points have a limited number of users it can handle. More users connected to an access point means lower performance per user. Access points will do better if they do not have too many channels overlapping. A characteristic of access points is they use roaming to give a user the best signal possible.</p><p>This means as a user moves around then then their device will connect to the closest access point in order that they get the strongest signal possible. To do this effectively the access points must have the same SSID (Service Set Identifier) and authentication information.</p><p>If you have a lot of access points in a general area then you will want to use a wireless controller. This controller device can manage multiple access points and make it easier for the admin to know what is happening with the network. The controller does this by the LWAPP ( Lightweight Access Point Protocol).</p><p>A wireless network is often on its own VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network). This helps segment the traffic and keep it from bothering other parts of your network that may be more vital.</p><h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Topologies</strong></h2><p>A network topology is the physical layout of your network. It is the cables, routers, switches, workstations, and hardware like that. Cables, for example, are something like category-5 or category-6. Routers are what accepts the signal from your ISP usually. Switches help distribute your network.</p><p>They also segment it as well when needed. Workstations are usually your PC's or laptops that you do the work from. There are many different kinds of topologies. Network engineers have been designing layouts as long as networks have been around. The following is a partial list of the most popular:</p><ul><li><span style="color: #008000;">Bus</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">Star</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">Ring</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">Mesh</span></li></ul><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Networking Basics: Bus Topology</strong><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-159"><img class="lazyload" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/nt1.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt1-xs.png 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt1-sm.png 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt1-md.png 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt1-lg.png 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt1-xl.png 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt1-2xl.png 1600w" alt="networking basics" data-aspectratio="1.413953" width="608" height="430"></figure></h3><p>This is one main trunk that splits off to each device point. Each device connects to the main trunk.  They used to be really popular but not anymore. The trunk was a single point of failure so not good these days. While it was easy to set up, it became very slow in higher traffic networks. It is a topology where a straight line of cable connects all of your devices. This is how the original Ethernet networks were done in businesses.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Networking Basics: Star Topology</strong></h3><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-162"><img class="lazyload" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/nt2.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt2-xs.png 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt2-sm.png 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt2-md.png 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt2-lg.png 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt2-xl.png 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt2-2xl.png 1600w" alt="networking basics" data-aspectratio="1.415493" width="603" height="426"></figure><p style="text-align: left;">The star topology is most often used today. It is also quite simple. Get a router, lots of cable, and any more switches that you might need and just connect all of your devices. This is a very flexible set up. It is more expensive with the cost of cabling and extra switches.</p><p style="text-align: left;">One of the great things about this set up is that you can add or remove devices without disrupting your whole network. For example, if a workstation goes down and you have to work on it you can just disconnect and fix it. This will not affect anything else.</p><p>Ethernet hub and switch networks all use a Star topology.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Networking Basics: Ring Topology</strong></h3><figure class="size-full wp-image-163 aligncenter"><img class="lazyload" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/nt3.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt3-xs.png 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt3-sm.png 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt3-md.png 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt3-lg.png 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt3-xl.png 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt3-2xl.png 1600w" alt="networking basics" data-aspectratio="1.415094" width="600" height="424"></figure><p>This is very simple. A ring network just forms a loop. Each workstation is connected to 2 others. The last one is connected to the first in this set up. It is easy to figure out where a workstation is messing up at. The worst thing about this set up is that if one computer goes down then the rest start having problems passing information along the network.</p><p>The Ring topology is similar to a bus topology in that there is a single point of failure. This type of network operated by passing a token around the network and only the device with the token can transmit data.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Networking Basics: Mesh Topology</strong></h3><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-164"><img class="lazyload" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/nt4.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt4-xs.png 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt4-sm.png 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt4-md.png 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt4-lg.png 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt4-xl.png 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt4-2xl.png 1600w" alt="networking basics" data-aspectratio="1.415094" width="600" height="424"></figure><p>Mesh networking is still used a lot in wireless applications. This set up is going to be more complicated and more expensive. It is more complicated because all of the devices are interconnected. Settings have to be adjusted on the switch because of this. The switch has to allow for traffic to come from everywhere at once. It is more expensive because of the cabling mostly. You also have to have a switch capable of this too which may add some cost as well.</p><p>Mesh networks are common in WAN's (wide area network). In this topology every device talks to every other device. This is very expensive to implement as the number of connections grow substantially with every new workstation. This is why partial meshes are used a lot and the full mesh.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Point To Point Networks</strong></h3><p>You would use this type of network to connect different locations to make them the same network. Since each location would have its own router you would just connect these two routers together most likely in a serial connection.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Client Server Networks</strong></h3><p>This is the most common type and what we often associate with a network traditionally. In this type of network the network services are provided by a server or multiple servers. Network services could be:</p><ul><li><span style="color: #008000;">printing</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">email</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">active directory</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">web page</span></li></ul><p>The server would decide what device or uses gets to access resources.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Peer To Peer Network</strong></h3><p>There are not really any servers in this kind of network. All the workstations are independent and equal. To get this kind of scenario to work you would have to have an account made for every computer that wanted to access your resources. Peer to Peer networks are usually small. The reason why they are small is that network resources become very slow in a large network.</p><p>As you can see there are several types of topologies and ways to design networks. Each one will have their advantages and the best situation to use them in.</p><p>Networking is not terribly hard to learn. It does take some diligence though. You also have to practice the concepts often. I have just introduced the basics in this guide. In future articles we will talk about more complicated practices but I will still be referencing these basic concepts occasionally. They all build on each other. Networking is very fun though. So later when it gets harder just remember how cool it is to understand how routing and the internet really works!</p><p>Other Networking Posts:</p><ul><li><a href="http://aindien.com/scaling-network-2016.html">http://aindien.com/scaling-network-2016/</a></li><li><a href="http://aindien.com/how-to-make-the-jump-to-system-administrator.html">http://aindien.com/how-to-make-the-jump-to-system-administrator/</a></li></ul><p> </p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Network Devices</h2><p>There are a lot of different kinds of network devices being made right now. They used to be much simpler as well. Now, we see hybrid devices as well as dedicated network devices. They mix and match functions as needed. There is almost always a device for your needs. The trouble is finding the right one for your network.</p><p>I am hoping this article will clear up some of the mystery about the network devices and what they do. If you know the information in my guide then you should be able to make a smart decision when you are ready to make a purchase.</p><p>If you missed my previous Networking articles then you might want to start here with these:</p><p><a href="http://aindien.com/scaling-network-2016.html">Scaling Your Network In 2016</a></p><p><a href="http://aindien.com/networking-basics-physical-topologies.html">Networking Basics: Physical Topologies</a></p><p><a href="http://aindien.com/computer-networking-networking-hardware.html">Computer Networking: Networking Hardware</a></p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Networking Hub</strong></h2><p>Hubs are examples of simple network devices. For the most part, it is not smart or managed. It is simple a pass-through for data packets. It does provide a means of connecting parts of your network together. This is what it is usually used for. A hub can not send and receive information at the same time like a nice switch can.</p><p>In today's networked world, you do not often see plain hubs anymore. A switch or router often does the job of a hub plus its own tasks. Routers have really taken over the roles of older network equipment. It is common to see routers that have firewalls, switching capabilities, and other functions all within a single box.</p><p>Where hubs are useful is connecting parts of a network together that do not need any specialized management. There are a few places where this applies in businesses. Most of the time though hubs work well in homes to extend a network for added network devices. Its main advantage is that it will be cheaper than a switch or a router.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"> </h2><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Unmanaged Switches</strong></h3><p>A switch is a better device than a hub. While it will be more expensive it also does a lot more and will make your network a little faster. Multiple switches are often used at a single location. The number of switches you have is determined by how large an environment you have.</p><p>Large networks will have many network devices like switches and access points for example. Switches can be a 4-port or a 48-port variety. They allow different parts of your network to talk to each other.</p><p>A switch can be a simple unmanaged type. This means it will work after hooking it up. Nothing to configure. This is often home networking equipment though and has far fewer features of good managed switches.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Managed Switches</strong></h3><p>Managed switches are very nice network devices. They are often faster and can be configured o work with your network. A big advantage of a managed switch is that they can monitor traffic on your network. There status can be indicated simple by looking at them using there software. You can also remote into a switch and perform any necessary tasks that you need.</p><p>Unlike a hub, switches can inspect network traffic before it sends it on. Packet inspection is what makes these devices really valuable. They only send traffic forward that meets requirements. This makes your network quicker and more reliable.</p><p>Most regular switches operate at the second level of the OSI networking model. So they are called level 2 switches. This is the data link layer which pretty much tells you what they are used for. You can now buy switches that feature some routing capabilities which are level 3. These are hyrbid devices that contain the functionality of both types of devices.</p><p>Network switches have a lot of features these days. You can choose based on speeds which are copper or fiber. There is the option of layer 2 or layer 3 switches depending on your network's needs. Sizes range from 4 to 48 port usually so there is a lot to choose from there. Extra features you should look at are PoE, IPv6, and redundant power supplies.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Network Router</strong></h2><p> </p><p>The most basic function of a router is deciding how and where to send packets of information. It routes information. By routing information a router also connects networks together.</p><p>The most common example of this is connecting a Lan with an ISP in order to get outside connectivity to that network and thus get internet access to your Lan. A router is a layer 3 device on the OSI model. This is the networking layer.</p><p>It is best to use a hardware router instead of software. This is because physical networking devices will have their own processor and memory so performance will be better.</p><p>Network routers also do everything that hubs and switches can do also. This is also why they are generally the most expensive of devices.</p><p>Networking routers can also include other great features. A firewall is a very common feature and is a good idea. It will help keep your network safe and working better. Routers will also include VPN's.</p><p>This allows offsite connection to your network for those that need it. It is common for businesses to offer this feature to employees. You can control who uses a VPN and what access they have with it. It is quite useful.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Network Firewall</strong></h2><p>A firewall is a hardware or software device that provides security by filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic. The traffic is filtered by a set of rules. These rules can be the default as set by the manufacturer or customized by you in software that acts as a firewall. There are a few different types of firewalls too. They are packet filtering, stateful, and application firewalls for your network.</p><p>Packet filtering firewalls just examine the network packets themselves. They are not very complicated because of this. They do not consider connections as they are unaware of this factor.</p><p>Stateful firewalls can see the connection status of packets. This feature makes them much more valuable and flexible for your system. Only after they have analyzed the packets will they then apply firewall rules to them.</p><p>Application firewalls do all of this and more. They actually analyze the data that is transmitted. This is key to maintaining the integrity of your network. This data traffic can then be matched to known sources of either good or bad data set up in your rules.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>VPN Concentrator</strong></h2><p>VPN stand for virtual private network. It is a useful way for people to remotely connect to networks that are in another geographic location. They are often physical network devices. Though similar to a router, it is only for setting up and maintaining VPN's. It will take care of the data and security invovled in users creating their connections. So it sets up VPN tunnels securely and manages all of that for you.</p><p>Now a long time ago these VPN concentrators were produced seperately. They were their own physical devices. However, these days the functionality is usually built in to firewalls.</p><p>A VPN concentrator, to be clear, is designed for multiple connections occurring from different locations.</p><p>A site to site VPN is not the same as a VPN concentrator. It is used for establishing a persistent connection from 1 or 2  locations that never change. An example of this would be two or three offices who want a permanent connection between themselves.</p><p> </p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Intrusion Prevention System</strong></h2><p>IPS stands for Intrusion Prevention System. An intrusion is when someone tries to break into your network. Intruders are often outside your network but unfortunately can also be within your own network. It is always a good idea to watch for this scenario. Its job is to analyze packets and deny them entry if they seem suspicious.</p><p>Once an attack has been verified it will then try to log the activity. This is important so the activity can be looked at in detail at a later time. Your IPS will then try to stop the attack. Lastly it will report the attack based on settings you had previously provided.</p><p>An IPS can be separate as in software based or it can be part of some firewalls. If you can, it is a good idea to have both a firewall and an IPS. A popular software based IPS is Snort. It is a good idea to have both on your network because it is an extra layer of defense and works differently than firewalls. This difference is what lets them work well together.</p><p>This difference is that a firewall either accepts or blocks traffic depending on the rules you provide. An IPS will examine the traffic once it is inside the network and watches it carefully to make sure it does nothing wrong. If the traffic turns out to be bad then it gets blocked.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>How IPS Works</strong></h3><p>It operates between your network and the internet usually. The most common configuration is to sit directly behind the firewall. It is usually a good first buy for companies because it is better to keep intruders and known sources of evil out of your network as a first step.</p><p>After you buy one it is important to adjust it to your network needs. If you do not then you will most likely have a large amount of false positives or you will be letting in all kinds of bad traffic. Detection methods are usually signature based. This is the easiest way to block known varieties of attacks instead of just one individual attack at a time.</p><p>Ideally after it is set up you would want a few false positives but not too many. This is far better then false negatives into your system. If it is tuned in this way it should keep the attacks out while only giving you a few false positives. That is the goal in setting this system up.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Wired and Wireless Access Points</strong></h2><p> </p><p>An access point acts as a distribution center to connect wireless network devices. They can be either wired or wireless themselves. Wired access points are connected by cat5 or cat6 cables if they are wired. Once data reaches an access point it will convert this data to either 2.4 or 5 Gig Hz signals.</p><p>Another use is to even connect networks to each other but this is not very common. Even more rarely is to bridge wireless and wired connections. They are usually not smart or managed devices. Essentially they are distribution points. They can connect using wireless signals too.</p><p>Since they are distribution points it is important to remember that they do not have any security features like a firewall would. If you have need of those features just make sure you shop around enough to find what you need.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Home Use For Access Points</strong></h3><p>At home it is often convenient to use wireless versions of these access points in order to give you greater coverage. They are easy to install and just connect wirelessly to your existing router. Businesses will often add several of these a larger building.</p><p>If your access point is wired then it is operating in full-duplex mode. This means that it can upload and download data simultaneously. Working this way indicates that your connection is faster and more reliable than wireless. It is more reliable because it can detect collisions of packets.</p><p>Now if your access point is wireless it is going to be operating in half-duplex mode. This is essentially half of the connection speed of a wired connection. Also there is no collision detection capability in half-duplex mode.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Network Content Filter</strong></h2><p>Content filtering is the use of certain kinds of software to screen for objectionable content. This is usually in the form of web pages or email. For web pages it is called web filtering. When dealing with email it is often called anti-spam software.</p><p>Web filtering is pretty straightforward. When the data for a web site comes in then the web filtering software examines it and decides if it should be displayed or not. The settings are applied at the router level. From the router all computers that send packets to and from it operate under the settings of the web filtering software.</p><p>A good example of web filtering software is OpenDNS. This software is what I use at home. It is free for home use and works very well. It is a very useful network device</p><p>Email filtering is similar to web filtering. Your software will examine the incoming email for certain strings of text that identify it as something bad for your environment. This process often works by using rules that you can set up.</p><p>There are open source varieties of content filtering as well. These are primarily for Linux/BSD systems. Some of the more popular ones are Untangle and Squid. These allow you to adjust literally every setting. Considering that, they are for more advanced users who want total control over their environment. They do work well though. Any professional IT person would have no trouble with these.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Network Load Balancers</strong></h2><p>A Load Balancer does one important thing. It distributes network traffic from one source to several sources to lighten the load on any particular server. For large websites this is one of the most important network devices that they will have. This is very important among huge workloads and high traffic servers.</p><p>Another example of this a high traffic server that runs a popular application. This technique will increase reliability and performance. Clustered servers or standalone servers will work with a Load Balancer.</p><p>The Load Balancer sits between the servers and your internet connection. It handles network traffic from there. If any particular server becomes unavailable the Load Balancer will distribute traffic to the other servers seamlessly. In the same vein, if more resources are added, such as another server, then traffic will automatically get routed to the new server on an equal basis.</p><p>This also makes your infrastructure more flexible because you can add or take away servers at any time. The Load Balancer will then re-distribute the network traffic.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Types Of Load Balancers</strong></h3><p>There are different kinds of Load Balancers. They operate differently based on the needs of your network. Load Balancer Algorithms work in a variety of ways.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #008000;">Round Robin  -  This Algorithm distributes network requests in the order they came.</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">Least Connection  -  This Algorithm looks at the traffic of each server and send its request to the one with the least traffic.</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">IP  -  You can decide where certain IP addresses go from the very start if that is how you want to do it.</span></li></ul><p>They can come in hardware and software versions. There are advantages to each type. Using them helps your reliability too because then you do not have a single pint of failure for your system. This is very important and wise to set up your infrastructure like this.</p><p>Hardware Load Balancers will typically work better as long as you have the correct solution in place and have provided for future growth. It has its own processors. They are not very flexible though. For example, if you outgrow your current piece of hardware then you have to buy another usually.</p><p>Software Load Balancers are very flexible. Load Balancers can be run on a local server or a virtual server in the cloud. They are most often quite a bit cheaper than a dedicated hardware version. However, they are actually installed on the servers and will use the servers processor and memory to operate.</p><p> </p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Basics Of Network Security</strong></h3><p>The <a href="https://aindien.com/networking-basics-physical-topologies.html">basics of network</a> security encompasses a lot of different areas. It ranges from giving users least privilege access to keeping physical doors locked so only proper people have access. So its the process of protecting the <a href="https://aindien.com/scaling-your-network-in-2016.html">network</a>. You take precautions to protect the data on your network. The best way to do this is by adding multiple layers of protection. Each layer means it adds a small bit of protection, each in a different way. </p><p>One of the easiest ways of protecting the network is using good passwords. What I mean by this is by using long passwords. They do not have to be overly complex. Really, they just need to be long as possible. Use letters and numbers, but not something that is easily found out. Try for 15-20 charcters if possible. Symbols are nice, but don't do such a complex password that you don't use it correctly. That is the important part.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Updating Applications</strong></h3><p>This is really big. Most vulnerabilities that are exploited are because of outdated software. You should update <a href="https://aindien.com/networking-basics-applications-of-network-devices.html">applications</a> at least once a month, if not more. This gets the latest security fixes for each of these applications. It is vital for network security. The best way to update is by using a package manager for your operating system. They exist for all operating systems so they should be used. I know they are in <a href="https://aindien.com/essential-linux-commands-to-get-you-started.html">Linux</a>, BSD, Mac, and <a href="https://aindien.com/getting-started-with-windows-10-accounts.html">Windows</a>. This allows you to script updates, which can then be scheduled. When they are scheduled, they happen automatically. You don't have to remember to do them if they are scheduled. This means they will always get done.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Firewalls</strong></h3><p>I've touched on firewalls before in other articles. They are important enough to mention again. Firewalls can be <a href="https://aindien.com/computer-networking-networking-hardware.html">hardware</a> or software. Hardware versions are more expensive and are for people that don't know how to configure their own software firewall. Software firewalls can be configured to any degree and have almost unlimited flesibility. The downside is that you have to learn them. However, since they decide who and whats gets into your network at a traffic level, they are <a href="https://aindien.com/networking-essentials.html">networking essentials</a>. </p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Logs</strong></h3><p>Every operating system has logging capability. These logs show events that happen. It is important to learn how to interpret them. They give clues about potential intrusions and evidence if your network comes under attack. There are even powerful applications that can log even more than a typical operating system. </p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Antivirus</strong></h3><p>Most people are familiar with the term anitivirus. They vary from free to very expensive products. Large businesses usually get the expensive products. It is debatable whether every operating system needs antivirus but something minimal won't hurt at least. Some suites get so involved in your machine they actually have worse effects than the spyware they are supposed to protect from. So keep that in mind.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>VPN</strong></h3><p>This stands for virtual private network. It is often used to securely connect to a network from an alternate location. There are other uses but this is one of the most common. It carries encrypted data that is being routed from one network to another. It uses the PPP protocol.</p><p>People often use public or home networks to connect back to their office. They use a VPN for this. It is software that establishes a point to point connection in a secure way.</p><p>You will need both a client and a server. The client is what you will install on your own machine, like a laptop. The server software will be installed by your <a href="https://aindien.com/how-to-make-the-jump-to-system-administrator.html">administrator</a> and maintained by him. You can use virtually any type of connection for a VPN.</p><p>It is good to use VPN’s because they are very cheap. There are many open source solution that are totally free and work very well. Adding users is trivial because often they are using public or home networks. They are also very easy to use, as its usually a matter of just putting in credentials and hitting connect. So you will rarely need any support for them.</p><p>To get everything working properly, the VPN software using a couple different protocols.One is PPTP which stands for point to point tunneling protocol. It is built off PPP and is what created the secure tunnel between the two networks. The other protocol is L2TP which stands for Layer 2 tunneling Protocol. It delivers the data through the secure tunnel.It does the authentication between both points of the tunnel.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>IPsec</strong></h3><p>The IP Security protocol provides secure communications between two networks. It consists of two sub-protocols. They are known as Authentication Header and the Encapsulating Security Payload protocols. Authentication Header provides authentication while Encapsulating Security Payload handles encryption.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Access Control</strong></h3><p>An access control can be any of several different ways an administrator can control who gets on the network.</p><p>Mandatory access control is probably the most secure mechanism. With this system, administrators can control every aspect of their network and who accesses it. It works by assigning security attributes to every user and object within the network. If a user tries to access a shared drive, their access is compared to the access level assigned to that shared drive. If it’s the same or higher, then they can see the data.</p><p>Discretionary access control is a little different. This can be controlled by the creator of a file. They give permissions to the file which decides on who can access it. It uses an access control list, which is a list of attributes for everything.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Network Access Control</strong></h3><p>This is another way that network security can be managed. Network access control can restrict access based off of a posture. A posture is your machine’s current state regarding security. It wants certain attributes and up to date virus definitions for example. A posture assessment is an evaluation done by the network access control.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>RDP</strong></h3><p>Remote desktop protocol is a good way access secure resources or machines. It is used on Windows machines. It uses a graphical environment to help users. It uses a client-server architecture. One machine must have an RDP client while the machine to be accessed will have a RDP server running. It uses the TCP port 3389. It is important to allow use of RDP on the machine you want to access. It should be off by default for security reasons.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>SSH</strong></h3><p>Secure shell protocol is another very popular way of accessing remote machines. It is similar to RDP in that respect but done quite differently. It is often used on the command line as it is very flexible. It has every day use on Linux machines because of this. Windows can also use it with the OpenSSH software now available. It is mostly used to remotely connect to machines and execute any commands that you want. It uses port 22.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>MAC Filtering</strong></h3><p>If a machine has access to the internet, it will have a network controller. Most machines do obviously. This <a href="https://aindien.com/computer-networking-devices.html">network controller</a> will have a unique address on that came from the manufacturer. There will be none like it with that address. This lets MAC filtering work. As an administrator, you can decide what machines can use your network resources or deny certain machines to them. This is an easy way to control who can access your network.</p></div></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 10, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://aindien.com/networking/">Networking</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fnetworking-essentials.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fnetworking-essentials.html&amp;via=_Aindien&amp;text=Networking%20Essentials" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://aindien.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://aindien.com/how-to-start-with-arrays-in-c.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> How To Start With Arrays In C++</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://aindien.com/intro-to-network-security.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Intro To Network Security </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-07-31T12:06" class="feed__date">July 31, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/c-essentials.html" class="invert">C++ Essentials</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-10-08T20:18" class="feed__date">October 8, 2017</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/computer-networking-devices.html" class="invert">Computer Networking Devices</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-04-10T07:48" class="feed__date">April 10, 2017</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/networking-basics-applications-of-network-devices.html" class="invert">Networking Basics: Applications of Network Devices</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><style type="text/css">#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }
