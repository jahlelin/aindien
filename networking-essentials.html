There are computer networks everywhere these days. From the business to our homes, local area networks and wireless systems are common and easy to create.</div><div> </div><div></div><div> </div><div> <h2 class="align-center"><strong>Chapter 1 - Networking Basics</strong></h2><p>Before I go any farther I need to cover a few basics. This will be at a real high level but I will expand this as time goes on. To make a network you need a few pieces of correct and compatible hardware.</p><ol><li>Computer</li><li>Network Card</li><li>Cabling</li><li>Wireless Networking</li><li>Router/Switch</li></ol><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Computer</strong></h3><p>The computer can be just about anything from a small netbook to a powerful workstation. Having them roughly the same type will help though. They will all need network cards. These cards are usually PCI based and do the communications with the network. Computers and workstations can have more than one network card in them now too. Cabling also has several options. The most common is category-5 cable but category-6 is making headway and superior. The cables will connect to the router or switch, depending on where it is in the chain of devices.</p><p>It will not matter if the computer is a Mac, Windows, and Linux machine. They will all have a network card these days where you can plug an ethernet cable into.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Network Card</strong></h3><p>Network cards do the communicating with the network. Your cabling plugs into them. There are many standards today which govern their usage. There are so many because they describe the types of cable used, distances involved and other such things that do not matter to most people. The most important thing is the speed which is usually of the gigabit variety. There are many reliable vendors today that make network cards. Many kinds of devices these days can be networked. They include computers, printers, scanners, thermostats, cameras, doorbells, and even sound systems. Network cards often have indicator lights on them so it is easy to see the status of that particular connection.</p><h3 class="align-center">Cabling</h3><p>Ethernet technology is by far the most prevalent type of cabling in the networking world today. You will actually have a hard time finding anything else. The main reason for this is cost as equipment and cabling are key factors and the speeds reachable by it. It is a protocol. That means it has the rules that the devices try to follow.</p><p>Category 5 cable is the most used cabling because there is so much of it out there. It is good and works with anything. Category 6 cable is what you should buy if you have newer equipment as it is superior to older cable types.</p><ul><li>RJ11 - this is the old telephone connector but is also used for broadband connections.</li><li>RJ45 - this is the connector for Ethernet cabling.</li><li>RJ48 - connector used for T1 and ISDN connections.</li><li>DB-9 - used for RS232 serial connections which is used for management</li><li>DB-25 - older parallel printer type connection.</li><li>BNC - good connector used in both IT and AV industries.</li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Twisted Pair Cabling</strong></h3><p>The ISO/IEC 11801 standard governs how twisted pair cabling is used. One type is of course Catergory 5 cabling which can be either 100 mbit Ethernet or 1000mbit Ethernet. You would have to have a compatible network card that used one or both of those speeds. The current version is category 6 cabling and it is even faster at theoretical speeds of 10 gbit. Twisted pair cabling is then divided up into UTP (unshielded twisted pair) and STP ( shielded twisted pair).</p><ul><li>Unshielded Twisted Pair - made of insulated copper wires that have been twisted around each other to form wire pairs.</li><li>Shielded Twisted Pair - shielded twisted pair cable is used where there is a lot of inteference such as around power wires.</li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Wireless Networking</strong></h3><p>Wireless networking is the other technology used today and it is used by everyone. It exists along and works with Ethernet networks greatly and is a core component of all networks today. It has standards associated with it also which mostly designate speed differences but also how it works. Examples of standards are a,b, g,n, and the current one today, the AC standard. AC is currently the fastest of the ones in major use today but there are more improvements and thus more standards out there but they are not in common use yet.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Router/Switch/Access Point</strong></h3><p>Most people are aware of the common router you can buy at consumer electronics stores. These are actually access points equipped with routing functionality. They use radio waves to communicate with the network card in your laptop or another access point when you want to extend the distance of your wireless network.</p><p>Wireless networks are governed by the IEEE 802.11 standards. Access points are used to provide a hot spot for wireless clients in the vicinity. Wireless networks operate as a hub and spoke topology. They also are shared and use CSMA/CA.</p><p>Routers will often have a small built in firewall to help with security. There are numerous types of functionality that can be built into these pieces of equipment. I cover many of these in other articles. One important thing to remember is that routers are usually at the edge of your network.</p><p>Switches are usually connected to the router at some point and help segment your network. You will want this if you have multiple buildings or areas with computing equipment in them. These can be small 4 port devices to larger 48 port devices. Switches can also be un-managed or managed network devices.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Routers and Access Points</strong></h3><p>Access points have a limited number of users it can handle. More users connected to an access point means lower performance per user. Access points will do better if they do not have too many channels overlapping. A characteristic of access points is they use roaming to give a user the best signal possible.</p><p>This means as a user moves around then then their device will connect to the closest access point in order that they get the strongest signal possible. To do this effectively the access points must have the same SSID (Service Set Identifier) and authentication information.</p><p>If you have a lot of access points in a general area then you will want to use a wireless controller. This controller device can manage multiple access points and make it easier for the admin to know what is happening with the network. The controller does this by the LWAPP ( Lightweight Access Point Protocol).</p><p>A wireless network is often on its own VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network). This helps segment the traffic and keep it from bothering other parts of your network that may be more vital.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Topologies</strong></h3><p>A network topology is the physical layout of your network. It is the cables, routers, switches, workstations, and hardware like that. Cables, for example, are something like category-5 or category-6. Routers are what accepts the signal from your ISP usually. Switches help distribute your network.</p><p>They also segment it as well when needed. Workstations are usually your PC's or laptops that you do the work from. There are many different kinds of topologies. Network engineers have been designing layouts as long as networks have been around. The following is a partial list of the most popular:</p><ul><li>Bus</li><li>Star</li><li>Ring</li><li>Mesh</li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Networking Basics: Bus Topology</strong><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-159"><img class="lazyload" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/nt1.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt1-xs.png 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt1-sm.png 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt1-md.png 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt1-lg.png 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt1-xl.png 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt1-2xl.png 1600w" alt="networking basics" data-aspectratio="1.413953" width="608" height="430"></figure></h3><p>This is one main trunk that splits off to each device point. Each device connects to the main trunk.  They used to be really popular but not anymore. The trunk was a single point of failure so not good these days. While it was easy to set up, it became very slow in higher traffic networks. It is a topology where a straight line of cable connects all of your devices. This is how the original Ethernet networks were done in businesses.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Networking Basics: Star Topology</strong></h3><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-162"><img class="lazyload" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/nt2.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt2-xs.png 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt2-sm.png 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt2-md.png 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt2-lg.png 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt2-xl.png 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt2-2xl.png 1600w" alt="networking basics" data-aspectratio="1.415493" width="603" height="426"></figure><p>The star topology is most often used today. It is also quite simple. Get a router, lots of cable, and any more switches that you might need and just connect all of your devices. This is a very flexible set up. It is more expensive with the cost of cabling and extra switches.</p><p>One of the great things about this set up is that you can add or remove devices without disrupting your whole network. For example, if a workstation goes down and you have to work on it you can just disconnect and fix it. This will not affect anything else.</p><p>Ethernet hub and switch networks all use a Star topology.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Networking Basics: Ring Topology</strong></h3><figure class="size-full wp-image-163 aligncenter"><img class="lazyload" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/nt3.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt3-xs.png 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt3-sm.png 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt3-md.png 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt3-lg.png 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt3-xl.png 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt3-2xl.png 1600w" alt="networking basics" data-aspectratio="1.415094" width="600" height="424"></figure><p>This is very simple. A ring network just forms a loop. Each workstation is connected to 2 others. The last one is connected to the first in this set up. It is easy to figure out where a workstation is messing up at. The worst thing about this set up is that if one computer goes down then the rest start having problems passing information along the network.</p><p>The Ring topology is similar to a bus topology in that there is a single point of failure. This type of network operated by passing a token around the network and only the device with the token can transmit data.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Networking Basics: Mesh Topology</strong></h3><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-164"><img class="lazyload" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/nt4.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt4-xs.png 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt4-sm.png 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt4-md.png 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt4-lg.png 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt4-xl.png 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/7/responsive/nt4-2xl.png 1600w" alt="networking basics" data-aspectratio="1.415094" width="600" height="424"></figure><p>Mesh networking is still used a lot in wireless applications. This set up is going to be more complicated and more expensive. It is more complicated because all of the devices are interconnected. Settings have to be adjusted on the switch because of this. The switch has to allow for traffic to come from everywhere at once. It is more expensive because of the cabling mostly. You also have to have a switch capable of this too which may add some cost as well.</p><p>Mesh networks are common in WAN's (wide area network). In this topology every device talks to every other device. This is very expensive to implement as the number of connections grow substantially with every new workstation. This is why partial meshes are used a lot and the full mesh.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Point To Point Networks</strong></h3><p>You would use this type of network to connect different locations to make them the same network. Since each location would have its own router you would just connect these two routers together most likely in a serial connection.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Client Server Networks</strong></h3><p>This is the most common type and what we often associate with a network traditionally. In this type of network the network services are provided by a server or multiple servers. Network services could be:</p><ul><li>printing</li><li>email</li><li>active directory</li><li>web page</li></ul><p>The server would decide what device or uses gets to access resources.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Peer To Peer Network</strong></h3><p>There are not really any servers in this kind of network. All the workstations are independent and equal. To get this kind of scenario to work you would have to have an account made for every computer that wanted to access your resources. Peer to Peer networks are usually small. The reason why they are small is that network resources become very slow in a large network.</p><p>As you can see there are several types of topologies and ways to design networks. Each one will have their advantages and the best situation to use them in.</p><p>Networking is not terribly hard to learn. It does take some diligence though. You also have to practice the concepts often. I have just introduced the basics in this guide. In future articles we will talk about more complicated practices but I will still be referencing these basic concepts occasionally. They all build on each other. Networking is very fun though. So later when it gets harder just remember how cool it is to understand how routing and the internet really works!</p></div><div><h2 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 2  -  Scaling Your Network</h2><div> </div><div>What happens though when you want to connect 2 or more local area networks together? Well it gets really interesting then. Most organizations aspire to grow. When an organization or business grows they will need to connect remote offices. Connecting your lans together or just adding wireless in a wide area network is the natural evolution of scaling your infrastructure.</div><div> </div><p>The purpose of scaling your network is allowing it to grow. Rarely do networks need to remain their original size. Over time you need to add more <a href="https://aindien.com/computer-networking-devices.html">devices</a>, rooms of equipment, or possibly even another location. This applies to both homes and businesses so it is equally applicable.</p><figure class="size-full wp-image-60 aligncenter"><img class="lazyload" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/scale_network2.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network2-xs.png 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network2-sm.png 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network2-md.png 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network2-lg.png 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network2-xl.png 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network2-2xl.png 1600w" alt="scaling your network" data-aspectratio="1.413098" width="561" height="397"></figure><p> </p><p>You have hooked a few computers together through a switch. Then you added a <a href="https://aindien.com/network-basics-easy-addressing-and-routing.html">router</a> to get to the internet. So you have a nice shiny new network. This could be at home or a small business. What now? How do you make it even more useful? How do you get it to the size you need? These are all questions I hope to answer.</p></div><h2> <strong>Scaling your Network : Budgeting</strong></h2><p>This is one of the key points. you just have to budget for updated equipment and software these days. Figure out what you can do and set it aside at some regular interval. Even if you do not use that money every interval at least let it grow so you can be saving for that new switch or backup router. You don't want your only router to go down and not have a replacement ready.</p><p>The same goes for software considerations. Occasionally everything just needs to be updated. Whether no one develops for it anymore or it just stops getting security patches, you need to be ready to move on if it does not meet your needs anymore. The only way to do this is to have a budget for a replacement when you get the idea it will need to be replaced soon.</p><p> </p><div><h3 style="text-align: center;">Scaling Your Network : Understanding Its Characteristics</h3><p>Understanding what your network consists of is key to planning for future growth and budgeting. You could have a small network with only a single server to multiple locations and a hundred servers. Whatever it is, you need to know what all is involved and a little bit of how it works.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"> </h3><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Local Area Network</strong></h3><figure class="size-full wp-image-61 aligncenter"><img class="lazyload" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/scale_network3.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network3-xs.png 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network3-sm.png 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network3-md.png 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network3-lg.png 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network3-xl.png 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network3-2xl.png 1600w" alt="scaling your network" data-aspectratio="1.413098" width="561" height="397"></figure><p> </p><p>Local area networks are made up of switches, routers, cables, computers and information. Switches have less capabilities than routers but will send traffic to different areas. Routers are quite intelligent these days. Expanding your lan is the usual way you will start scaling your network to make it larger and more useful.</p><p>They are smart and will route traffic to different areas as well as decide what is the best route. They also will make sure your traffic gets through if part of your network goes down. Information, or data, is the key thing here.</p><p>Most people do not think about this at all. Your entire reason for having a network is the storage and manipulation of data. Your network is information. It does not matter whether you analyze spreadsheets all day, code your new cloud software or play games, you still have information that needs to move around on the network.</p></div><div> </div><div>It does not matter the location either. Your network can be at home or the office or in another <a href="https://aindien.com/what-cloud-computing-really-means.html">country</a>. One local area network will at least be similar to another.  They will include workstations that people use to do things for fun or work.</div><div> </div><div>A server may or may not actually be in a local area network like this. If it does, though, it will provide services like file storage or printing over the network.</div><div> </div><div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Wide Area Network</strong></h3></div><div> </div><div>So what is missing is something to link these local area networks together into a larger network which is called a wide area <a href="https://aindien.com/network-management-guide.html">network</a>. Connecting your lans together in a wide area network is what cities and large businesses do when they need to connect their offices and share data. Price and know how has always been the limiting factors here. Scaling your network at this level is not the easiest thing to do.</div><div> </div><div>The price can be rather expensive. It is usually not for the home user. This is for large businesses or organizations with a lot of resources. The technical knowledge required to implement a solution like this is not for the average hobbyist either. It can get quite complicated. There are many technologies at play here and they all have their quirks. Getting them to work right is often times a pain.</div><div> </div><div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Digital Routers</strong></h3><figure class="size-full wp-image-62 aligncenter"><img class="lazyload" data-src="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/scale_network4.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network4-xs.png 300w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network4-sm.png 480w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network4-md.png 768w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network4-lg.png 1024w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network4-xl.png 1360w ,file://C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Publii/sites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/3/responsive/scale_network4-2xl.png 1600w" alt="scaling your network" data-aspectratio="1.413098" width="561" height="397"></figure></div><div> </div><div>These are called digital routers. They link local area networks together. The following link is the kind of router I am talking about. As your computer must interface to the network, so must your network connect likewise to this special router that provides, of course, routing services for your local area network. These routers are more expensive than your usual home router. They are quite special and even many businesses will not use these. </div><div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Fixed Line Services</strong></h3></div><div> </div><div>These days though, many people do not need to worry about all the details of how things work. They can still get the same services without worrying about the technicalities. The reason is that they can get and then pay for fixed lines that do the hard work for them. Many companies now offer this service. This is where they come out and install the infrastructure and then either you or them can manage things for you.</div><div> </div><div> </div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Scaling Your Network : Technologies Used In A Wan</strong></h3><p>If you have a larger network then you undoubtedly use 1 or more of the following technologies. Businesses often use a mix or older and newer technology. Since this is a more complicated routine than setting up a small house hold network, there are several technologies used to integrate everything together. Some of these are ATM, Frame Relay, SONET, and X.25. Some of these are very old but there are several companies that still use them. Communication using one of these protocols is essential in scaling your network in order for it to connect to other networks.</p><div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>ATM</strong></h3><p>ATM stands for asynchronous transfer mode. It is one of the more current technologies and still used a lot by equipment.  It is a digital system unlike the old telephone system that was once used. Speeds obtained from ATM are limited mostly by the media and and your cash. Fiber optics will be your best media here.</p><p>The protocol used in ATM to get all this done is call cell switching. These are very tiny packets and are called cell switching. They are called this because the packets are so small. It is very fast too. It is able to reach speeds of 10 gbps.</p></div><div> </div><div>Atm is characterized by its type of connections. There are point to point and point to multi-point connections. Point to point is when packets get broadcasted continually until they reach their destination. Point to multi-point is just what it sounds like. One node broadcasts several sets of packets to several  destinations at once. </div><div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>SONET</strong></h3><p>This is the synchronous optical network.  It is used a lot these days for WAN connectivity and can also be used in digital technology since fiber is used with it extensively. Being very popular for very large areas, it is very versatile in what it can do. SONET can transfer and carry almost any kind of data.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>X.25</strong></h3></div><div> </div><div>X.25 is an old but still sometimes used technology for packet switching. It is analog and kind of slow by today's standards. It is consistent and reliable though which was one of its better features. Also it was used mainly for simple devices that did not need much speed. </div><div><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Frame Relay</strong></h3><p>This technology is like X.25 but is digital. It is still used but near as much as it used to be.  Being faster than X.25 though  makes it a great alternative. Performance in your usual environment makes good use of your existing bandwidth. </p></div><h3 style="text-align: center;">Scaling Your Network : Choosing Vendors</h3><p>The equipment and software that you buy on a regular basis is vital to your success. If you buy hard drives because they are cheap then either your customers or your staff will be disappointed. That will not be good for your business. Stability is very important in this regard. Use a quality vendor that sells solid infrastructure.</p><p>You also want a vendor that is just a little larger than you are. That is the best recipe for your business. The reason why is that they will be close enough in size to understand what you need. However, since they are a bit larger than you, you can take advantage of their better pricing.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Increasing Your Storage</strong></h3><p>Sometimes to grow your network you will need to first increase your storage capabilities. This can happen in many ways and no two situations are identical. This means that you will need to evaluate what makes sense for your situation and budget.</p><p>Adding some direct attached storage is an easy and quick way if you have a very small network. Choosing network attached storage is the next step and is typical of a large home network or still a small business setting. A SAN(storage area network) is popular for businesses that can afford them.</p><p>Don't fall into the trap of getting more than you need even if you can afford it. You should only get the technology that makes sense for you. For example, getting a SAN dramatically increases the complexity of your storage and is a lot more expensive than plain network attached storage. I am just saying be careful is all.</p><div><h3 style="text-align: center;"> </h3></div><div> </div><div>Connecting your <a href="https://aindien.com/aindiens-guide-to-network-communications.html">lans together</a> in a wide area network has many advantages. It can bring together your remote offices, simplify your software needs and centralize your main server infrastructure. Implementing a Wan or any of its technologies is very expensive and complicated though.</div><div> </div><div>That is usually why only large organizations or large businesses do this at all. The newer Cloud technologies aim to improve this by making things steadily cheaper. Hopefully it will succeed in doing that.</div><div> </div><div><p>Networking is a popular topic. Microsoft has extensive needs in their systems. Cisco certifications are always highly sought after. It only helps your career if you have knowledge of networking basics.  It is how we play our lan games and how our phones communicate also.</p><p>Being a very popular subject because of Cisco jobs and equipment especially, I wanted to start a series to address it. At the most fundamental level you have the different topologies. Networking topology, at its core, describes in a high level view how a network is set up.</p><p>There are many different kinds of topologies such as Ethernet, bus, ring, star and some other obscure ones. In actuality though, Ethernet is the only one worth talking about these days as most of the others have fallen out of use. </p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 3  -  Network Devices</h2><p>There are a lot of different kinds of network devices being made right now. They used to be much simpler as well. Now, we see hybrid devices as well as dedicated network devices. They mix and match functions as needed. There is almost always a device for your needs. The trouble is finding the right one for your network.</p><p>I am hoping this article will clear up some of the mystery about the network devices and what they do. If you know the information in my guide then you should be able to make a smart decision when you are ready to make a purchase.</p><p> </p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Networking Hub</strong></h3><p>Hubs are examples of simple network devices. For the most part, it is not smart or managed. It is simple a pass-through for data packets. It does provide a means of connecting parts of your network together. This is what it is usually used for. A hub can not send and receive information at the same time like a nice switch can.</p><p>In today's networked world, you do not often see plain hubs anymore. A switch or router often does the job of a hub plus its own tasks. Routers have really taken over the roles of older network equipment. It is common to see routers that have firewalls, switching capabilities, and other functions all within a single box.</p><p>Where hubs are useful is connecting parts of a network together that do not need any specialized management. There are a few places where this applies in businesses. Most of the time though hubs work well in homes to extend a network for added network devices. Its main advantage is that it will be cheaper than a switch or a router. </p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Unmanaged Switches</strong></h3><p>A switch is a better device than a hub. While it will be more expensive it also does a lot more and will make your network a little faster. Multiple switches are often used at a single location. The number of switches you have is determined by how large an environment you have.</p><p>Large networks will have many network devices like switches and access points for example. Switches can be a 4-port or a 48-port variety. They allow different parts of your network to talk to each other.</p><p>A switch can be a simple unmanaged type. This means it will work after hooking it up. Nothing to configure. This is often home networking equipment though and has far fewer features of good managed switches.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Managed Switches</strong></h3><p>Managed switches are very nice network devices. They are often faster and can be configured o work with your network. A big advantage of a managed switch is that they can monitor traffic on your network. There status can be indicated simple by looking at them using there software. You can also remote into a switch and perform any necessary tasks that you need.</p><p>Unlike a hub, switches can inspect network traffic before it sends it on. Packet inspection is what makes these devices really valuable. They only send traffic forward that meets requirements. This makes your network quicker and more reliable.</p><p>Most regular switches operate at the second level of the OSI networking model. So they are called level 2 switches. This is the data link layer which pretty much tells you what they are used for. You can now buy switches that feature some routing capabilities which are level 3. These are hyrbid devices that contain the functionality of both types of devices.</p><p>Network switches have a lot of features these days. You can choose based on speeds which are copper or fiber. There is the option of layer 2 or layer 3 switches depending on your network's needs. Sizes range from 4 to 48 port usually so there is a lot to choose from there. Extra features you should look at are PoE, IPv6, and redundant power supplies.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Network Router</strong></h3><p> The most basic function of a router is deciding how and where to send packets of information. It routes information. By routing information a router also connects networks together.</p><p>The most common example of this is connecting a Lan with an ISP in order to get outside connectivity to that network and thus get internet access to your Lan. A router is a layer 3 device on the OSI model. This is the networking layer.</p><p>It is best to use a hardware router instead of software. This is because physical networking devices will have their own processor and memory so performance will be better.</p><p>Network routers also do everything that hubs and switches can do also. This is also why they are generally the most expensive of devices.</p><p>Networking routers can also include other great features. A firewall is a very common feature and is a good idea. It will help keep your network safe and working better. Routers will also include VPN's.</p><p>This allows offsite connection to your network for those that need it. It is common for businesses to offer this feature to employees. You can control who uses a VPN and what access they have with it. It is quite useful.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Network Firewall</strong></h3><p>A firewall is a hardware or software device that provides security by filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic. The traffic is filtered by a set of rules. These rules can be the default as set by the manufacturer or customized by you in software that acts as a firewall. There are a few different types of firewalls too. They are packet filtering, stateful, and application firewalls for your network.</p><p>Packet filtering firewalls just examine the network packets themselves. They are not very complicated because of this. They do not consider connections as they are unaware of this factor.</p><p>Stateful firewalls can see the connection status of packets. This feature makes them much more valuable and flexible for your system. Only after they have analyzed the packets will they then apply firewall rules to them.</p><p>Application firewalls do all of this and more. They actually analyze the data that is transmitted. This is key to maintaining the integrity of your network. This data traffic can then be matched to known sources of either good or bad data set up in your rules.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>VPN Concentrator</strong></h3><p>VPN stand for virtual private network. It is a useful way for people to remotely connect to networks that are in another geographic location. They are often physical network devices. Though similar to a router, it is only for setting up and maintaining VPN's. It will take care of the data and security invovled in users creating their connections. So it sets up VPN tunnels securely and manages all of that for you.</p><p>Now a long time ago these VPN concentrators were produced seperately. They were their own physical devices. However, these days the functionality is usually built in to firewalls.</p><p>A VPN concentrator, to be clear, is designed for multiple connections occurring from different locations.</p><p>A site to site VPN is not the same as a VPN concentrator. It is used for establishing a persistent connection from 1 or 2  locations that never change. An example of this would be two or three offices who want a permanent connection between themselves.</p><p> </p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Intrusion Prevention System</strong></h3><p>IPS stands for Intrusion Prevention System. An intrusion is when someone tries to break into your network. Intruders are often outside your network but unfortunately can also be within your own network. It is always a good idea to watch for this scenario. Its job is to analyze packets and deny them entry if they seem suspicious.</p><p>Once an attack has been verified it will then try to log the activity. This is important so the activity can be looked at in detail at a later time. Your IPS will then try to stop the attack. Lastly it will report the attack based on settings you had previously provided.</p><p>An IPS can be separate as in software based or it can be part of some firewalls. If you can, it is a good idea to have both a firewall and an IPS. A popular software based IPS is Snort. It is a good idea to have both on your network because it is an extra layer of defense and works differently than firewalls. This difference is what lets them work well together.</p><p>This difference is that a firewall either accepts or blocks traffic depending on the rules you provide. An IPS will examine the traffic once it is inside the network and watches it carefully to make sure it does nothing wrong. If the traffic turns out to be bad then it gets blocked.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>How IPS Works</strong></h3><p>It operates between your network and the internet usually. The most common configuration is to sit directly behind the firewall. It is usually a good first buy for companies because it is better to keep intruders and known sources of evil out of your network as a first step.</p><p>After you buy one it is important to adjust it to your network needs. If you do not then you will most likely have a large amount of false positives or you will be letting in all kinds of bad traffic. Detection methods are usually signature based. This is the easiest way to block known varieties of attacks instead of just one individual attack at a time.</p><p>Ideally after it is set up you would want a few false positives but not too many. This is far better then false negatives into your system. If it is tuned in this way it should keep the attacks out while only giving you a few false positives. That is the goal in setting this system up.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Wired and Wireless Access Points</strong></h3><p> An access point acts as a distribution center to connect wireless network devices. They can be either wired or wireless themselves. Wired access points are connected by cat5 or cat6 cables if they are wired. Once data reaches an access point it will convert this data to either 2.4 or 5 Gig Hz signals.</p><p>Another use is to even connect networks to each other but this is not very common. Even more rarely is to bridge wireless and wired connections. They are usually not smart or managed devices. Essentially they are distribution points. They can connect using wireless signals too.</p><p>Since they are distribution points it is important to remember that they do not have any security features like a firewall would. If you have need of those features just make sure you shop around enough to find what you need.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Home Use For Access Points</strong></h3><p>At home it is often convenient to use wireless versions of these access points in order to give you greater coverage. They are easy to install and just connect wirelessly to your existing router. Businesses will often add several of these a larger building.</p><p>If your access point is wired then it is operating in full-duplex mode. This means that it can upload and download data simultaneously. Working this way indicates that your connection is faster and more reliable than wireless. It is more reliable because it can detect collisions of packets.</p><p>Now if your access point is wireless it is going to be operating in half-duplex mode. This is essentially half of the connection speed of a wired connection. Also there is no collision detection capability in half-duplex mode.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Network Content Filter</strong></h2><p>Content filtering is the use of certain kinds of software to screen for objectionable content. This is usually in the form of web pages or email. For web pages it is called web filtering. When dealing with email it is often called anti-spam software.</p><p>Web filtering is pretty straightforward. When the data for a web site comes in then the web filtering software examines it and decides if it should be displayed or not. The settings are applied at the router level. From the router all computers that send packets to and from it operate under the settings of the web filtering software.</p><p>A good example of web filtering software is OpenDNS. This software is what I use at home. It is free for home use and works very well. It is a very useful network device</p><p>Email filtering is similar to web filtering. Your software will examine the incoming email for certain strings of text that identify it as something bad for your environment. This process often works by using rules that you can set up.</p><p>There are open source varieties of content filtering as well. These are primarily for Linux/BSD systems. Some of the more popular ones are Untangle and Squid. These allow you to adjust literally every setting. Considering that, they are for more advanced users who want total control over their environment. They do work well though. Any professional IT person would have no trouble with these.</p><h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Network Load Balancers</strong></h2><p>A Load Balancer does one important thing. It distributes network traffic from one source to several sources to lighten the load on any particular server. For large websites this is one of the most important network devices that they will have. This is very important among huge workloads and high traffic servers.</p><p>Another example of this a high traffic server that runs a popular application. This technique will increase reliability and performance. Clustered servers or standalone servers will work with a Load Balancer.</p><p>The Load Balancer sits between the servers and your internet connection. It handles network traffic from there. If any particular server becomes unavailable the Load Balancer will distribute traffic to the other servers seamlessly. In the same vein, if more resources are added, such as another server, then traffic will automatically get routed to the new server on an equal basis.</p><p>This also makes your infrastructure more flexible because you can add or take away servers at any time. The Load Balancer will then re-distribute the network traffic.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Types Of Load Balancers</strong></h3><p>There are different kinds of Load Balancers. They operate differently based on the needs of your network. Load Balancer Algorithms work in a variety of ways.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #008000;">Round Robin  -  This Algorithm distributes network requests in the order they came.</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">Least Connection  -  This Algorithm looks at the traffic of each server and send its request to the one with the least traffic.</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">IP  -  You can decide where certain IP addresses go from the very start if that is how you want to do it.</span></li></ul><p>They can come in hardware and software versions. There are advantages to each type. Using them helps your reliability too because then you do not have a single pint of failure for your system. This is very important and wise to set up your infrastructure like this.</p><p>Hardware Load Balancers will typically work better as long as you have the correct solution in place and have provided for future growth. It has its own processors. They are not very flexible though. For example, if you outgrow your current piece of hardware then you have to buy another usually.</p><p>Software Load Balancers are very flexible. Load Balancers can be run on a local server or a virtual server in the cloud. They are most often quite a bit cheaper than a dedicated hardware version. However, they are actually installed on the servers and will use the servers processor and memory to operate.</p><p> Network Basics: Easy Addressing and Routing is all about the TCP/IP protocols and what they do. Our present day internet is totally dependent on this system because because of how it developed and without a doubt it can be confusing.</p><p>Think about it:</p><p>The reason TCP/IP was used was because it was rock solid. However, it seems like there are a million details to it and I am sure you would agree with me. The addressing and routing that moves all of our internet traffic between Facebook, Twitter, and all of our other favorite websites uses TCP/IP primarily so there has to be a reason for it right? There really is so let me explain to it to you.</p><h2 class="align-center"><strong>Chapter 4  -  Easy Addressing and Routing</strong></h2><p>IP addressing is the system that dictates how every device communicates with each other over a <a href="http://aindien.com/scaling-network-2016.html">private network</a> or the internet as a whole. Every device must have a unique name and be identified thusly so all our computers who to talk to.</p><p>Our current system of addressing uses standard IPv4 mostly because that is what people have used for many years. IPv4 is actually divided up into classes depending on the size of the networks and how it is used.</p><p>IPv6 is the newest system and it is our insurance for the future because it has a multitude more addresses to use. We have this system because IPv4 is running out of addresses soon and this just can not happen. So IPv6 will prevent any address shortages for a long time by our standards.</p><h3 class="align-center"> <strong>IPv4 Addressing</strong></h3><p>All computers or <a href="http://aindien.com/networking-basics-applications-network-devices.html">network devices</a> need an IP address if they are to talk over small networks or the internet. Addresses are composed of four sets of numbers and they look like the form of 123.456.789.001. Each position represents and on/off bit which can either 0 or 1. This is just decimal to binary conversion but it is good to know anyway.</p><p>IP addresses are divided up into classes so it will make more sense when we see an address. There are class A,B,C in use and two more which are D and E. Those last two classes are reserved and are not actually in <span style="color: #339966;">production</span> use. The address class tells you which of those bits are used for the network ID and which are used for the host ID. This indirectly tells us how many hosts can be on any one network.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">a network that uses subnetting is considered a classless</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">the classful system has several limitations</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">many networks still rely on classless addressing and custom subnet masks</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">IPv4 identifies a network or subnet and the host</span></li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>IPv4 Characteristics</strong></h3><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">they are a 32-bit binary number</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">represented in dotted decimal notation</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">the address is divided up into two parts: a network identifier and the host divided by subnet mask</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">each host is required to have a subnet mask when using IPv4</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">the subnet mask is used to distinguish the network identifier from the host identifier</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">it divides the IPv4 address into those parts</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">subnet masks can be notated in dotted decimal or in CIDR notation</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">a subnet mask that divides an IPv4 addressin half would be 255.255.0.0</span></li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>IPv4 Classes</strong></h3><p>These addresses are organized into classes for ease of distribution.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">they are defined by the number in the first octet and the default subnet mask</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Class-A networks use a 255.0.0.0 subnet mask</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Class-B networks use a 255.255.0.0 subnet mask</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Class-C networks use a 255.255.255.0 subnet mask</span></li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Class A Network</strong></h3><p>Class A networks are extremely large and have the largest number of hosts linked together. A host is a computer or some other type of network device that is on a particular network. The first octet is for the network ID while the last three octets are for the hosts. This kind of network can have 126 networks on it and each network  can have over 16 million hosts on each network. It has a range of 1-126 in the first octet.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Class B Network </strong></h3><p>These networks are still quite large but represent the mid size networks. They can comprise 16384 networks and 65534 hosts on each network. It has a range of 128-191 in the first octet.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Class C Network</strong></h3><p>These are for smaller networks whether a home local area network or a small business network. This type of network class allows for around 2 million networks and close to 250 hosts per network. The range for this class is 192-223 in its first octet.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Subnetting</strong></h3><p>A subnet looks like an IP address because it has the same format. However, the purpose of a subnet is to tell you which parts of the IP address refer to the network address and which parts are the host addresses. The different classes of networks that I just mentioned above each have a certain subnet associated with it.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #008000;">A  =  255.0.0.0</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">B  =  255.255.0.0</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">C  =  255.255.255.0</span></li></ul><p>Subnetting redefines the network portion to lengthen the mask beyond the default classful mask. It extends the network portion and allows one classful network to be repurposed as many classless subnetworks.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Purpose of Subnetting</strong></h3><p>The very important purpose of subnetting is to create more networks and therefore divide your network and its <a href="http://aindien.com/networking-basics-physical-topologies.html">topologies</a> up into more manageable pieces. For small network or home local area network then this does not apply but for a large network it makes good sense. The reason it makes good sense is that you can separate your departments by IP address or have a certain IP range for just your printers.</p><p>When you have a certain IP range for your HR department then you can keep HR's network traffic on its IP range. This keeps one department's network traffic from impacting another department. The important thing to remember here is that subnetting increases your network but decreases your available hosts.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Public Network</strong></h3><p>This type of network is just as it sounds. It is a public network that anyone can join and use the resources on. An example of a public network is something like a cafe offering free wireless while you drink their coffee. They usually have very limited speed and reliability. There is usually no authentication either.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Private Network</strong></h3><p>This is a type of network that does not allow access to just anyone. It will usually use a certain user name and password for each individual that wants to connect to it. However, these networks are usually faster and have more resources. Private IP addresses are provided for internal communication within an organizational environment.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Addresses of Private Networks</strong></h3><p>All networks have certain ranges within them that are used by only that network. This is called a private range. Public facing routers do not pass on information from private networks so that is why you can not use a private address on the internet. The private addresses must stay within a private network.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #008000;">A  =  10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">B  =  172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">C  =  192.168.0.0 to 255.255.255.0</span></li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>IPv6</strong></h3><p>This is a lot longer address that offers a lot more IP addresses. It is a 128-bit address and it is written as 32 hexadecimal characters. IPv6 offers support for unicast, multicast, and anycast communication.</p><ul><li>Unicast address is for a single interface</li><li>Multicast address is for a one to many interfaces and uses a larger address range.</li><li>Anycast is also a one to many type of addressing. Multiple devices can share the same address</li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>IPv6 Auto-Configuration</strong></h3><p>This generates the host IP addresses internally using stateless address autoconfiguration. It is also used to assign link-local addresses.</p><ul><li>Does not require the host to be aware of its present state to be assigned an IP address by the DHCP server.</li><li>If autoconfiguration is not going to be used then hosts can be assigned an IP address with DHCPv6.</li></ul><p> </p><h3 class="align-center"> <strong>Gateways</strong></h3><p>This is just the path from a local network to the rest of the networks in the world, or the internet. From a local area <a href="http://aindien.com/how-the-osi-model-works.html">network's perspective</a> it is the IP address of your router. That is the path out to the world from your local clients. When traffic on a local network is destined to go to another computer on that same network then things are pretty simple.</p><p>The traffic goes to where it needs to pretty quickly because all of the computers on the local network are already known to the rest of the computers. Everyone knows everyone in this sense.</p><p>However, when traffic needs to leave the local network it has to go through the gateway device. The gateway can be another computer but is usually a local router. The router communicates to other routers depending on where the traffic needs to go. Your router or gateway knows the routes so that your network traffic can get to the next step in its trip.</p><p>If there is no gateway device on your network or it is not configured to let traffic through then all your traffic will stay on your local network. An example of this is an application I run at home but I want it only on my local network so I do not set up my router to let its traffic go past my router. Since there is no route to go past my network then it will not use my gateway device.</p><h3 class="align-center"> <strong>Types of Addressing</strong></h3><p>There are different types of addressing and they are unicast, broadcast, and multicast. They serve different purposes depending on the situation.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Unicasting</strong></h3><p>When a unicast is started the packet information is sent to a specific IP address. This is useful when you want information to only go to one destination. This is the most common form of addressing as the other types are newer and legacy devices might not support them.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Broadcasting</strong></h3><p>This is when packet information is sent to to everything on your network or wherever your network can communicate to. It is sent from one device to many devices that are on your network.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Multicasting </strong></h3><p>Using a multicast, groups of devices on your network can send and receive information at the same time.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Assigning IP Addresses</strong></h3><p>There are two main ways to give your devices an IP address on your network. The first of which is doing it manually and this is called static addressing. Addressing your pc's and printers this way can take a long time so if you do it this way then you have to double check yourself. There are advantages to doing it this way if you need to because some devices you do not want changing addresses such as printers.</p><p>The other way to address your devices is letting DHCP do it and this is called dynamic addressing. DHCP is a protocol I have talked about before and it will run on a server to do the work of assigning IP addresses for you. It is most common to let DHCP handle your computer addressing in this way.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Static Addressing</strong></h3><p>Devices that need their IP addresses entered manually will have some way to input the addresses on a panel like printers do. I have to do this myself as I enter all of the printer IP addresses manually and then keep track of them through documentation. Then when someone needs to print to a certain printer I just look at the documentation if I need to set it up remotely.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Dynamic Addressing</strong></h3><p>Dynamic addressing is when the addresses are assigned and changed as needed. They are handled by the DHCP protocol and it does a great job of it. When a computer's address has been assigned to it, it will be for a certain amount of time and this is called its lease.</p><p>Just like when you lease a car it is for a specific time period. IP addressing is done the same way. After this lease runs out DHCP will assign different addresses to devices as they are needed.</p><p>Anything that needs to stay the same like switches or printers can also be put on a reservation which is similar to static addressing but within the DHCP sphere.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Boot Protocol </strong></h3><p>The BootP protocol was designed for network devices that needed to connect to networks and that did not have internal storage. The BootP application would be run on a server and and devices on the network that needed an IP address would call out to the server to get the correct information. The server uses MAC addresses to authenticate and keep track of the different devices.</p><p>An example I see often is printers having BootP in their set up. This is because printers do not usually have hard drives and BootP gives it one way to connect to a TCP/IP network.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>MAC Addresses</strong></h3><p>The MAC address of a device is the way to uniquely identify any device. Calling it the physical address is also accurate and this is used a lot. It uses a hexadecimal form and contains six different bytes of information in the address part.</p><p>An interesting fact is that the first three bytes of the address define the manufacturer of the network card and the last three bytes are given by the manufacturer to identify the network card.</p><p>Being hexadecimal in nature the addresses use the numbers 0-9 and the letters a-f in the address.</p><p>There is a newer and longer form of the MAC address now and it uses extra bytes and dashes in the address to differentiate it from its older cousin.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">48-bit long and represented in 12 hexadecimal characters that is hard coded into the network interface when it is made.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">They are completely unique to each network interface.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">The MAC address of a network card operates at the Data link layer of the OSI model.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">They are often called the physical addresses</span></li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>MAC Address Filtering</strong></h3><p>This is a simple process of only allowing equipment to join your network if its MAC address has been previously approved by adding them to a list.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">Any MAC address that is not approved will not be added to the ARP table and none of its broadcasts will be sent out to the network at large.</span></li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Network Address Translation</strong></h3><p>This is very important for one reason and that is because there are not enough IP's in the world. NAT allows us to just use one public IP that others can see. There can be many local IP's hiding behind this one public IP and these are the private address ranges that I mentioned earlier.</p><p>Your public IP is often a router and it will handle the network address translation protocol for your <a href="http://aindien.com/computer-networking-networking-hardware.html">networking hardware</a>. The router will then keep track of which machine on your network sent information so if information goes back to this machine then the router will make sure any data goes back to this machine. This is basically how network address translation works.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">Router based service which allows a router to change the IP addresses of the packets that they send.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">The private IP address never leaves the private side of the router because it is replaced, via NAT, with a routable public IP address.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Commonly used to translate private IP addresses to public IP addresses.</span></li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Static NAT</strong></h3><p>Allows a one to one translation of public to private IP addresses to be configured.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">Often used to provide a translation for an internal server that must be reached from the internet.</span></li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Port Address Translation </strong></h3><p>The port address translation protocol allows an administrator to just use one IP address and configure his clients to use certain ports that will allow traffic. Doing things like this is especially useful if you want to secure your network a little more than usual because it hides so much of your client's information.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">Is a form of dynamic NAT which allows many IP addresses to translate to a single public IP address.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Maintains separate entries for each of the sessions passing through the router by recording the source and destination ports of the sessions.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">It is extremely popular and is used primarily to provide many workstations the ability to access the internet without each needing their own IP address.</span></li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Port Forwarding</strong></h3><p>This is also called the destination network address translation protocol. That is a long name but people rely on this every day. This is handled at the router level to change where network packets are sent. Their IP addresses are changed for the destination and this allows applications to communicate through networks. Gamers use this all the time when they want to play the same games together even though they may not realize it.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Broadcast Domains</strong></h3><p>A broadcast is a transmission sent from one device which is destined for all other devices in a network.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">They  are the area of a network through which a broadcast propagates.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Subnets can be interconnected by a router.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">The broadcast originating in one subnet is then not propagated into another subnet.</span></li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Collision Domains</strong></h3><p>A collision can occur when two different Ethernet devices on a network transmit data simultaneously.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">Collision domains are the portion of a network across which only one frame can exist at one time.</span></li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Routing</strong></h3><p>Routing is the backbone of the internet and wide area networks. Without routing the devices on your network would not be able to get out to other networks.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Routing Loops</strong></h3><p>A routing loop can occur when static or dynamic routing is incorrectly configured.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">They can be identified with the traceroute utility.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">If a packet hits the same router more than once, this is a good indication of a routing loop.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Packets in a routing loop will be forwarded between two or more routers until the TTL expires.</span></li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Managing TCP/IP</strong></h3><p>Managing TCP/IP is a straight forward process. Computers and routers deal with the routing tables that specify paths for your network information. You then just decide what type of routing you want to do and that is either static or dynamic routing. Variations exist as well and those are distance-vector and link-state routing.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Routing Tables</strong></h3><p>Routing tables keep track of the paths for information. Computers and routers look a them and decide which is the fastest route. This helps make the network reliable and as quick as possible. Your router needs this information to send data through and it can get it by either static or dynamic routing.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">Routers maintain their own routing table.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">These tables contain information about the networks directly attached to the router.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">They also contain entries that inform the router how to get to all subnets or classful networks in a topology.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Most routers have a default route.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">The default route provides the router with a direction to forward traffic when it has no other information.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Routers share their routing tables with other routers in the environment.</span></li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Static Routing</strong></h3><p>Static routing is manually entering your network information into your devices. If you have a very large network this can take you lots of time and there are probably better options out there. Changes to a network also make this more complicated and a headache because you then have to go back and manually update your devices again.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">This type uses a route that a network administrator enters into the router manually.</span></li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Dynamic Routing</strong></h3><p>Dynamic routing has the routers retrieving its own information as it needs and it uses protocols to do it. The routers communicate among themselves to establish the best route for network packets. Dynamic routing uses the distance-vector and link-state protocols.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">Uses a route that a network routing protocol adjusts automatically for topology and traffic changes.</span></li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Distance-Vector Routing</strong></h3><p>Routers use this protocol to talk to the routers that are directly connected to it and show each of them its own router information. Routers have worked like this for a very long time. Network information travels from one router to the next like this in a series of hops. Routers update their routing tables very frequently and in a large network this causes a lot of traffic over time, it can slow down the network, and errors often happen between routers.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Link-State Routing</strong></h3><p>Routers that use link-state routing have an entire layout in their memory of routes to send network information to. This is in contrast to distance-vector routing where routers only know about the next hop. So link-state routing is much quicker and efficient. Updates between routers still happen but do so less frequently because the routers know so much more about the network they are on.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Proxy Servers</strong></h3><p>Proxy servers are part of your security plan for your network and often work with your firewall. They send and accept network traffic on behalf of your clients. A proxy server adds more functionality to your network system to help protect it. Adding speed to your network through the process of caching is one of the major benefits of a proxy server.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Route Availability</strong></h3><p>Everyone wants high availability in their systems. They should always be up.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">A first hop router redundancy protocol can provide redundancy for a default gateway.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">There is Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Also there is Hot Standby Router Protocol</span></li></ul><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Routing Metrics</strong></h3><p>Hop counts is something that we can measure and monitor. This is the number of stops a packet will need to make before it reaches its destination.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #339966;">Bandwidth and the maximum size of the data packets that a route can carry.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">There is also the cost and efficiency of the router.</span></li><li><span style="color: #339966;">Latency is also important and this is the time it takes for a data packet to traverse the route to reach its destination</span></li></ul><p>A lot of things happen in order for your network information to get from one network to another. You have different routes and many protocols that can be used depending on the situation. There is never a shortage of options or acronyms when learning about this either. Understanding subnetting and the routing of traffic are especially important here.</p><p> </p><p>I have talked about computer networking devices before in previous articles. Today, however, I will go into more detail and cover some of the more common devices in more depth. The most common devices are access points, routers, firewalls, and switches. In their respective sections I want to discuss some of the details that I had to leave out before.</p><h2 class="align-center"><strong>Chapter 5 - Computer Networking Devices</strong></h2><p>For those who like to scan articles first, here is a partial list of what I will be talking about today.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #008000;">Routers</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">Firewalls</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">Switches</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">Access Points</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">Vlans</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">Beginning Configurations</span></li></ul><p>There are many more types of computer <a href="http://aindien.com/networking-basics-applications-network-devices.html">networking devices</a> but in this article I wanted to concentrate on the more popular and essential devices that will be in your network. Then I will end with Vlans and some configurations that you would likely see when first setting up these devices. I would encourage you to obtain one or two of these to play with and get to know for your home lab.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Routers</strong></h3><p>A <a href="http://aindien.com/network-basics-easy-addressing-and-routing.html">router</a> will often be the front networking device in your environment. Your ISP will give you internet access and you will usually connect this to your router device.</p><p>Their main purpose is to join two different networks together and send traffic through. For example, they will connect to both the Internet and your local network. They can accept traffic from the Internet and send it to computer networking devices that are located on your network. It works the other way around too as your network can also send traffic through the router to the Internet too.</p><p>Routers can be many different types of devices but usually they will be their own contained device. This device will have networking software with it that will communicate to all other devices within their reach.</p><p>They work at the network layer of the OSI model because they mostly deal with IP devices. Once it receives data it can inspect it and then route it to the correct destination. It determines the proper destination from the header of the network packet. The destination is in the form of an IP address and is associated with another computer networking device.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Learning Routers</strong></h3><p>Learning how a real router works will be important for your career if you work in Information Technology. You will not have to touch a router every day but the concepts will help you support your network and diagnose issues. You have to understand how routers work and what all your model does to be able to do this.</p><p>Once you have a router to play with at home then set up a VPN or a VOIP system to better understand how your router works. These types of home projects are essential to a deep understanding and they will provide valuable insight into troubleshooting when problems do occur.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Firewalls</strong></h3><p>A <a href="http://aindien.com/computer-networking-networking-hardware.html">firewall</a> device can be a separate unit or a piece of software inside the router unit. If it is a separate unit then it will be next to the router so the firewall rules can easily be applied to the network traffic.</p><p>The firewall for a particular network will control access based on how it is set up. It should have clearly defined rules that allow or disallow based on certain conditions.</p><p>Linux and Windows operating systems have software firewalls built right in to them and they allow for configurations that work best for your environment. They are setup and configured quite differently so whichever you choose to learn just realize that Linux will be the more difficult to learn and configure. It will, however, give you greater control and power over your environment.</p><p>They serve different functions and can include many different features depending on the amount of money that was spent.</p><p>Stateful inspection firewalls are considered regular firewalls that you usually see. Unified threat management firewalls (UTM) are networking devices that combine many different functions into one unit.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Switches</strong></h3><p>Once you have an Internet connection and it gets through your firewall then it needs to go somewhere. This is what switches are for. They recreate and distribute your signal to other rooms or buildings that your network is in. They can have 4 ports or even 48 ports so you get the size that you need plus a few just in case. Your computers and printers will now plug into these switches.</p><p>Computer networking devices such as computers or printers will connect to a switch through twisted-pair cabling.</p><p>Switches can be pretty smart networking devices because they send signals to the correct device instead of to the whole network at once. The destination of the network packets is identified by the MAC address of the device. The MAC address is included with every networking interface card and that is how devices are located and referenced by switches.</p><p>This process greatly improves network performance and reliability.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Multilayer Switches</strong></h3><p>Multilayer switches operate as both a router and a switch. This means that it can talk to devices in its own network and outside networks like the Internet. Layer 2 switches are especially useful because they will send and receive traffic through different networks. They are essentially bridges because they join two different networks except they still function as a switch otherwise.</p><p>A layer 3 switch is also called a multilayer switch and this is the kind of switch that is usually meant when someone references a multilayer switch in their computer networking equipment. These switches can also be configured so that different ports on the switch can operate at either level 2 or level 3 which is very handy.</p><p>Layer 3 switches route traffic between Vlans so if you are using Vlans then you most likely have a layer 3 managed switch.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Access Points</strong></h3><p>These computer networking devices usually provide wireless signals to hard to reach areas. They can be either wired or wireless networking devices and they extend a wireless signal so that portable devices can more easily connect to your network. They send and receive data through an antenna.</p><p>The physical area your network covers will determine how many access points that you will need. You just want enough to do the job because too many access points will cause problems in your wireless signal. This is just as bad as not enough signal so be careful of this when installing your wireless network the first time.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Configuring Networking Devices</strong></h3><p>Configuring a device means to set it up a certain way. You can choose to have Vlans on your switches, decide what traffic will come through your firewall, and limit your wireless traffic on access points. There is obviously much that can be done and usually the task is not very difficult to implement.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Vlans</strong></h3><p>This acronym stands for virtual lans and that can be further broken down into virtual local area networks. It can sure get confusing sometimes. Vlans are like sub-networks because they divide up your physical network. A Vlan for a certain group makes it appear that group is on their own private network. Another term that is good to describe them is a segmented network and that is their true purpose.</p><p>Vlans are based on <a href="http://aindien.com/how-the-osi-model-works.html">logical connections</a> since their <a href="http://aindien.com/networking-basics-physical-topologies.html">physical connections</a> can be elsewhere on your network. Connect all of your computer networking devices and then start dividing your infrastructure up in logical units. It will not matter how they are connected at that point.</p><p>The information about any particular Vlan is on the switch that it was created on. Its information is held in a database that is contained within the switch.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Purpose of Vlans</strong></h3><p>Vlans, under the right circumstances, will make your network more secure ad better performing. We have many Vlans dedicated to printers at my day job because their IP address never changes. This keeps printing traffic separate from our Pc traffic. Printing is usually low priority traffic and does not need to be mixed in with our higher priority traffic with our databases that are doing key functions.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Trunk Ports</strong></h3><p>Trunk ports are specialized ports on a switch that is designed to accept traffic from another switch and send it on. It will be a high speed port such as fiber. While a trunk port can take all Vlan traffic, it can be configured to just accept traffic from a particular Vlan only. For trunking traffic to occur you must enable trunking on the two switches that you want to communicate in this way.</p><p>Any port on a switch will be either an access port or a trunk port. This port can't be set to both types at once however.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Port Binding</strong></h3><p>This lets you decide how to group ports together on a switch. To set this up on a switch you will have to log into its interface and probably go to its security section. You can also delete any settings for grouping your ports together and that just makes your switch more flexible.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Link Aggregation Control Protocol</strong></h3><p>The main purpose of this protocol is to let physical ports be grouped together in whatever way you want. It can have the effect of helping your bandwidth because ports are grouped.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Determining Vlan Roles</strong></h3><p>A Vlan can use a protocol, physical port, or a MAC address to group different networking devices. They can work different ways depending on which option you choose. That means there are advantages for each method.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Protocol Role</strong></h3><p>The protocol that you are using at the time will decide the Vlan that will get used. This is set up in advance depending on your needs i your organization.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Physical Port Role</strong></h3><p>Certain ports can be grouped together on a switch to handle your Vlans. You can divide your switch ports by department or building, whatever makes the most sense in your situation.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>MAC Role</strong></h3><p>This is another way to add computer networking devices to Vlans and it is also commonly used. You can put your accounting department into its own Vlan by adding the MAC addresses of their workstations to its on Vlan. It will appear to them that they are on their own network and they can also share resources meant just for them.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Default Vlan</strong></h3><p>Enabling Vlans in your network will create a default Vlan. Depending on your network equipment it could be called Vlan 1 or something similar.  This is used mainly for communication by the switches.</p><h2 class="align-center"><strong>Chapter  - Basics Of Network Security</strong></h2><p>The <a href="https://aindien.com/networking-basics-physical-topologies.html">basics of network</a> security encompasses a lot of different areas. It ranges from giving users least privilege access to keeping physical doors locked so only proper people have access. So its the process of protecting the <a href="https://aindien.com/scaling-your-network-in-2016.html">network</a>. You take precautions to protect the data on your network. The best way to do this is by adding multiple layers of protection. Each layer means it adds a small bit of protection, each in a different way. </p><p>One of the easiest ways of protecting the network is using good passwords. What I mean by this is by using long passwords. They do not have to be overly complex. Really, they just need to be long as possible. Use letters and numbers, but not something that is easily found out. Try for 15-20 charcters if possible. Symbols are nice, but don't do such a complex password that you don't use it correctly. That is the important part.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Updating Applications</strong></h3><p>This is really big. Most vulnerabilities that are exploited are because of outdated software. You should update <a href="https://aindien.com/networking-basics-applications-of-network-devices.html">applications</a> at least once a month, if not more. This gets the latest security fixes for each of these applications. It is vital for network security. The best way to update is by using a package manager for your operating system. They exist for all operating systems so they should be used. I know they are in <a href="https://aindien.com/essential-linux-commands-to-get-you-started.html">Linux</a>, BSD, Mac, and <a href="https://aindien.com/getting-started-with-windows-10-accounts.html">Windows</a>. This allows you to script updates, which can then be scheduled. When they are scheduled, they happen automatically. You don't have to remember to do them if they are scheduled. This means they will always get done.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Firewalls</strong></h3><p>I've touched on firewalls before in other articles. They are important enough to mention again. Firewalls can be <a href="https://aindien.com/computer-networking-networking-hardware.html">hardware</a> or software. Hardware versions are more expensive and are for people that don't know how to configure their own software firewall. Software firewalls can be configured to any degree and have almost unlimited flesibility. The downside is that you have to learn them. However, since they decide who and whats gets into your network at a traffic level, they are <a href="https://aindien.com/networking-essentials.html">networking essentials</a>. </p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Logs</strong></h3><p>Every operating system has logging capability. These logs show events that happen. It is important to learn how to interpret them. They give clues about potential intrusions and evidence if your network comes under attack. There are even powerful applications that can log even more than a typical operating system. </p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Antivirus</strong></h3><p>Most people are familiar with the term anitivirus. They vary from free to very expensive products. Large businesses usually get the expensive products. It is debatable whether every operating system needs antivirus but something minimal won't hurt at least. Some suites get so involved in your machine they actually have worse effects than the spyware they are supposed to protect from. So keep that in mind.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>VPN</strong></h3><p>This stands for virtual private network. It is often used to securely connect to a network from an alternate location. There are other uses but this is one of the most common. It carries encrypted data that is being routed from one network to another. It uses the PPP protocol.</p><p>People often use public or home networks to connect back to their office. They use a VPN for this. It is software that establishes a point to point connection in a secure way.</p><p>You will need both a client and a server. The client is what you will install on your own machine, like a laptop. The server software will be installed by your <a href="https://aindien.com/how-to-make-the-jump-to-system-administrator.html">administrator</a> and maintained by him. You can use virtually any type of connection for a VPN.</p><p>It is good to use VPN’s because they are very cheap. There are many open source solution that are totally free and work very well. Adding users is trivial because often they are using public or home networks. They are also very easy to use, as its usually a matter of just putting in credentials and hitting connect. So you will rarely need any support for them.</p><p>To get everything working properly, the VPN software using a couple different protocols.One is PPTP which stands for point to point tunneling protocol. It is built off PPP and is what created the secure tunnel between the two networks. The other protocol is L2TP which stands for Layer 2 tunneling Protocol. It delivers the data through the secure tunnel.It does the authentication between both points of the tunnel.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>IPsec</strong></h3><p>The IP Security protocol provides secure communications between two networks. It consists of two sub-protocols. They are known as Authentication Header and the Encapsulating Security Payload protocols. Authentication Header provides authentication while Encapsulating Security Payload handles encryption.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Access Control</strong></h3><p>An access control can be any of several different ways an administrator can control who gets on the network.</p><p>Mandatory access control is probably the most secure mechanism. With this system, administrators can control every aspect of their network and who accesses it. It works by assigning security attributes to every user and object within the network. If a user tries to access a shared drive, their access is compared to the access level assigned to that shared drive. If it’s the same or higher, then they can see the data.</p><p>Discretionary access control is a little different. This can be controlled by the creator of a file. They give permissions to the file which decides on who can access it. It uses an access control list, which is a list of attributes for everything.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>Network Access Control</strong></h3><p>This is another way that network security can be managed. Network access control can restrict access based off of a posture. A posture is your machine’s current state regarding security. It wants certain attributes and up to date virus definitions for example. A posture assessment is an evaluation done by the network access control.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>RDP</strong></h3><p>Remote desktop protocol is a good way access secure resources or machines. It is used on Windows machines. It uses a graphical environment to help users. It uses a client-server architecture. One machine must have an RDP client while the machine to be accessed will have a RDP server running. It uses the TCP port 3389. It is important to allow use of RDP on the machine you want to access. It should be off by default for security reasons.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>SSH</strong></h3><p>Secure shell protocol is another very popular way of accessing remote machines. It is similar to RDP in that respect but done quite differently. It is often used on the command line as it is very flexible. It has every day use on Linux machines because of this. Windows can also use it with the OpenSSH software now available. It is mostly used to remotely connect to machines and execute any commands that you want. It uses port 22.</p><h3 class="align-center"><strong>MAC Filtering</strong></h3><p>If a machine has access to the internet, it will have a network controller. Most machines do obviously. This <a href="https://aindien.com/computer-networking-devices.html">network controller</a> will have a unique address on that came from the manufacturer. There will be none like it with that address. This lets MAC filtering work. As an administrator, you can decide what machines can use your network resources or deny certain machines to them. This is an easy way to control who can access your network.</p></div></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 13, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://aindien.com/networking/">Networking</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fnetworking-essentials.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fnetworking-essentials.html&amp;via=_Aindien&amp;text=Networking%20Essentials" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://aindien.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://aindien.com/how-to-start-with-arrays-in-c.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> How To Start With Arrays In C++</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://aindien.com/intro-to-network-security.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Intro To Network Security </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-09-19T13:44" class="feed__date">September 19, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/linux-essentials.html" class="invert">Linux Essentials</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-07-31T12:06" class="feed__date">July 31, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/c-essentials.html" class="invert">C++ Essentials</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2017-10-08T20:18" class="feed__date">October 8, 2017</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/computer-networking-devices.html" class="invert">Computer Networking Devices</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><style type="text/css">#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }
