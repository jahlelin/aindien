The modern desktop deployment center enables IT admins to push out Windows 10 and Office 365. And its part of Microsoft 365, which includes Windows 10, Office 365, and Enterprise Mobility plus security. Microsoft has modified its service and support for some additions of Windows 10. Microsoft has also revised its Windows 10 upgrade ability for Enterprise users.</div><div> </div><div>It also provides enhanced deployment tools for administrators. And Microsoft provides guides for admins who need to test and troubleshoot Windows 10 Deployment. So let's take a look at these specific features. Let's start with the modern desktop deployment center which assists organizations in the large scale deployment of Windows. It's designed to work with Windows 10 and Office 365 Pro Plus. And it includes a lab kit which you can download and install free of charge. So you can test deployments and train your IT department on how to deploy Windows 10 and Office 365.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] Screen title: Windows 10 Service and Support. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>On service and support, Microsoft recently extended its service and support from 18 months to 30 months for the September releases of Windows 10 Enterprise and Windows 10 Education additions. The September release number always ends with 09 and this extended support is retroactive, meaning the 30 month period applies to all past versions of Windows 10 September releases as well as September releases moving forward. March releases, those ending in 03, will still have the current 18 month service and support period. Windows 10 Home and Pro editions and Office 365 Pro Plus will continue to have 18 month service and support for both March and September editions.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] Screen title: Windows 10 Enterprise Upgrade. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>For Windows 10 Enterprise as of version 1703 or the March 2017 version commonly called the creators update, Microsoft gives you the ability to upgrade users from an Enterprise license to a Windows 10 Enterprise E3 or E5 subscription. If your organization has an Enterprise agreement with Microsoft or a Microsoft products and services agreement, and you currently have Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise, you can transition to Windows Enterprise E3 or E5 subscriptions on as many as five devices.</div><div> </div><div>Furthermore, Microsoft has made it easier for small and mid-sized companies to transition to Windows 10 Enterprise, by placing E3 in the Cloud Solution Provider or CSP Channel. Before Windows 10 version 1609, only organizations that had a Microsoft volume licensing agreement could push Windows Enterprise out to its users. But now it's available for anyone as a subscription, provided that they have at minimum an activated version of Windows 10 Pro version 1607. And Azure Active Directory, Azure AD with identity management activated.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] Screen title: Deployment Tools. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Windows Deployment has never been easier and never had such a robust selection of tools to choose from. Windows Autopilot is an automation tool for setting up and configuring new Windows devices and requires little end user intervention for users to get up and running. It can also be used to recover and reset devices. Upgrade readiness has been available since March 2017 and assists admins in preparing devices for Windows 10 upgrades.</div><div> </div><div>By assessing device, drivers, and apps and providing information on the most updated apps and drivers. As well as guidance to assist admins in the upgrading process. Update compliance tracks installations and status of monthly and semi-annual updates. Device health is a brand new Windows Analytics tool that works in lockstep with upgrade readiness and update compliance to find issues and assist admins in resolving them.</div><div> </div><div>The Microsoft Deployment toolkit, or MDT, is a suit of apps and information that admins can use for deployment automation. SetupDiag is a tool for diagnosing installation issues. And MBR2GPT is a non-destructive tool that lets admins convert disk partitions from the master boot record or MBR partitioning scheme to the more flexible GUID partition table or GPT partitioning scheme. In addition to permitting more than four partitions on a single physical disk, GPT is also necessary for hard disks that are larger than 2 terabytes.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] Screen title: Testing and Troubleshooting. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Finally, for windows 10 Deployment testing and troubleshooting, Microsoft provides several online resources for admins. Including a Windows 10 proof of concept guide, a guide for resolving Windows 10 upgrade errors, and other online content that can be leveraged by admins. So they understand the ins and outs of Windows 10 Deployment.</div><div> </div><h2> <strong>Modern Desktop Deployment Center</strong></h2><div> In this video, I'll discuss the benefits and steps of the Modern Desktop Deployment Center. And how to access the Modern Desktop Deployment and Management Lab Kit. The Modern Desktop Deployment Center is an online Microsoft resource designed for IT administrators to assist in the deployment of Windows 10.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] A Microsoft Deployment web page appears on the screen.

Under Step-by-step labs, the following steps are displayed: Device and App Readiness, Directory and Network Readiness, Office and LOB App Delivery, etc. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Common Deployment Situations</strong></h2><div>There are three basic deployment models for Windows 10. Modern deployment, which is the method Microsoft recommends for most scenarios. Traditional deployment using OS images, and Dynamic deployment in which you configure settings during deployment for systems on a case by case basis. Modern deployment assists in large scale deployment of Windows 10 and Office 365 Pro Plus. And there is a lab kit that you can download which allows you to test and train for Windows deployments.</div><div> </div><div>In a modern deployment situation you have access to several tools offered by Microsoft with Windows autopilot which automates the deployment process. Using autopilot there's very little up front configuration. Installations are pushed out to users who with a few simple steps are fully up and running with Windows 10. Autopilot doesn't need system images and there's no need to push out specific drivers. The other modern deployment scenario is using the traditional Setup.exe for Windows 10, when it's being deployed on older Windows versions, specifically 7, 8, and 8.1.</div><div> </div><div>Microsoft refers to this as an in-place update, and it migrates a system to Windows 10 without any loss of information or settings. Administrators can automate this method using tools like System Center Configuration Manager or Microsoft Deployment Toolkit. In a traditional deployment situation admins use existing tools that they'll already be familiar with. Like the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit, System Center Configuration Manager, Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit, and Windows Deployment Services. However, Microsoft has updated these tools to be fully operational with Windows 10.</div><div> </div><div>And while it's probably advisable to choose other methods than the traditional deployment model. Microsoft understands that some admins and organizations are comfortable with this model and intend to support it into the future. Microsoft sees the traditional deployment as applying to a handful of different scenarios. First, what it calls a bare metal deployment on new computers. And either a refresh of an OS already on the computer or replacing an existing computer with a new one. In the refresh or replace scenarios you can back up the system before changing it using Windows imaging or WIM.</div><div> </div><div>And you can preserve user settings and preferences using Microsoft's User State Migration Tool. Dynamic deployments can be used in special instances where the other two methods won't suffice. Microsoft acknowledges that organizations that have in the past used custom Windows images may need to continue to do so. But because this method was time consuming, they implemented dynamic provisioning, which is more efficient.</div><div> </div><div>In dynamic provisioning you have three options. First is Windows 10 Activation, which is a service that allows you to change a system from a Pro version to an Enterprise version without the need for activation keys or reboots. The next method is through Azure Active Directory or AAD and Mobile Device Management or MDM. In this scenario a user enters their username and password and the device is joined to Azure Active Directory and enrolled in Mobile Device Management. MDM will work to configure the device.</div><div> </div><div>Finally, there's the provisioning aspect of dynamic deployment where admins build a complete and customized installation package using the Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer or ICD. This is useful in organizations that allow employees to select hardware other than what's been identified as compatible by the organization. It's a phenomenon known as Choose Your Own Device or CYOD. And using the provisioning model will ensure that apps, drivers, and settings are properly installed and configured.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Activating Subscriptions</strong></h2><div>In this video, I'll discuss options for updating from Windows 10 Pro to Windows 10 Enterprise and how to check Windows 10 activation status.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] A Windows 10 desktop appears on the screen. Two items are present here: Recycle Bin and Microsoft Edge. At the bottom of the screen, a taskbar is present. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>If you have a license for Windows 10 Pro version 1703, that is the March 2017 update or later, you can easily update from Windows 10 Pro to Windows 10 Enterprise E3 or E5. It's now done without the need for license keys or rebooting. Additionally, if you are already using Windows 10 Enterprise and have a license for it, you can switch over to a subscription-based Windows 10 Enterprise.</div><div> </div><div>Furthermore, if your organization has an Enterprise agreement with Microsoft you can use Active Directory services to migrate to a Windows 10 Enterprise subscription. This option is available when a user who signs in with a device is synchronized with Azure Active Directory. So their Azure AD credentials are linked to an Enterprise license, either E3, or E5. It's a completely seamless transition.</div><div> </div><div>The Windows 10 Pro device will be automatically updated to Windows 10 Enterprise. And in the event that a subscription has expired, the device will automatically return to Windows 10 Pro. On a system level, you can check your activation status in Windows 10, activate your Windows 10 installation if it's not activated and even change your Windows 10 product key. So to access your aciivation status, click on the Start button on the Windows desktop.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] He clicks the Start button from the taskbar. The Start menu opens. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Click on the Settings charm.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] He clicks on the Settings icon. The Settings window opens. It has the following heading: Windows Settings. Below it, a search bar is present titled Find a setting. Below it, the following setting options are present: System, Devices, Phone, etc. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>And in Windows Settings, the very last category, Update &amp; Security, that's the one we want. So I'll go ahead and click that.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] He maximizes the window, a few more setting options appear: Cortana, Privacy, Update &amp; Security, etc. He clicks on Update &amp; Security. On the next screen, there is a search bar and a navigation pane with the following options: Windows Update, Windows Security, Activation, etc. On the right, the following heading is displayed: Windows Update. Below it, the following text is present: You're up to date. Below it, a button titled Check for updates is present followed by three hyperlink buttons: Change active hours, View update history, and Advanced options. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Now in left-hand pane, almost down near the bottom, the third last option is Activation. So if I click that, I'll get information about the activation status of my Windows system. And here we can see the Edition, Windows 10 Enterprise, and the activation, Windows is activated with a digital license.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] He clicks on Activation from the left pane. An Activation page opens on the right. It has two sections: Windows and Update product key. Under Windows, Edition and Activation details are present. The Edition reads: Windows 10 Enterprise and the Activation reads: Windows is activated with a digital license. Below it, a hyperlink button is present for Learn more. Under Update product key, the following text is displayed: To use a different product key on this device, select change product key. Below it, a hyperlink button is present for Change product key. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>We can get more information by clicking this link. And that'll open the web browser and give us some more information about activation in Windows 10.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] He clicks on Learn more. A Microsoft Support web page opens in a browser. At the top, it has a menu bar with the following options: Office, Windows, Surface, etc. The center pane shows the following heading: Activation in Windows 10. Below it, information related to activation is displayed. He then closes the browser. The screen comes back to the Activation page. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Now below that is Update product key. So if I needed to, if I for some reason needed to use a different product key on this particular computer, I could select this link and I could change my product key. Now it's worth mentioning that if your Windows system isn't activated, that here's where you're going to see a message telling you that.</div><div> </div><div>And typically it's down at the bottom of the screen and you'll see some sort of link that says something to the effect of, click to activate this version of Windows. Now on the right-hand side, there is a little bit more guidance, where's my product key? And this link, Get more information about activation, actually takes you to the same page that this one did on the left-hand side, Learn more. So you can get more information about activation and you can also get some help with this link if you have a question about Windows activation. And you can also click the Give us feedback link, if you want to provide some feedback to Microsoft about Windows activation.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] On the right of the Activation page, the following options are present: Where's my product key? Have a question? and Make Windows better. Under the Where's my product key? option, a hyperlink button is present for Get more info about activation. Under the Have a question? option, a hyperlink button is present for Get help. Under the Make Windows better option, a hyperlink button is present for Give us feedback. He hovers over each hyperlink button and talks about it.

There's a greater amount of detail here for IT admins new to the Windows 10 deployment process right up to seasoned admins. And this should be an invaluable resource for identifying and rectifying Windows 10 upgrade errors.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>How Autopilot Works</strong></h2><div>In this video, I'll discuss Windows Autopilot, and how it can be used to set up and configure devices. Windows Autopilot was released with Windows 10 version 1703, and is a suite of different technologies used to deploy Windows to new devices.</div><div> </div><div>It's a tool used for dynamic deployment of Windows 10 in networking environments, or for self deployment by a user. Autopilot can also perform resets of local devices on the network. And it allows admins to remotely reset systems. So let's drill down into how Autopilot works.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] Screen title: Device Ready. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Autopilot results in an end to end state of readiness for devices. Once Autopilot has configured a new device, it's licensed, has all the latest OS updates, contains all the software that the user has been designated to use, and all the users settings and data have been migrated to the device. Here's how it works. A user can log into the network with a device, using their company credentials. They're automatically joined to Azure Active Directory.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] Azure Active Directory is abbreviated as Azure AD. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>And Autopilot takes over completing configuration of the device while the user is finishing a small number of first time tasks. Intune handles the data flow from the network to the device. And in addition to configuring devices for the first time it also includes two reset options. Autopilot can also be used to perform resets of local devices on the network, essentially, wiping a system of unneeded files and resulting in a fresh machine.</div><div> </div><div>This feature could also be used to prepare a system that was used by a former employee, so it could be used by a new employee. And Autopilot lets admins remotely reset systems in collaboration with Intune. Remote resets have the same result as local resets, the only difference being that the reset device is remote.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Features and Benefits of Autopilot</strong></h2><div>In this video, I'll discuss the features and benefits of Windows Autopilot.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] Screen title: Autopilot Automates Deployment. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Windows Autopilot was released with Windows 10, Version 1703. And it's a suite of technologies used for automated deployment of Windows 10. Specifically, this tool is used for dynamic deployment of Windows 10 in networking environments or for self deployment by a user. In Autopilot deployment, a user can quickly and easily log in using a new device.</div><div> </div><div>And that connects it to Azure Active Directory, where Autopilot takes over. In conjunction with Intune, the device is configured in the background while the user interacts with first time setup steps. Autopilot can also perform resets of local devices on the network, and it allows admins to remotely reset systems. So let's drill down a bit into the features and benefits of Autopilot. Windows Autopilot has several interesting features.</div><div> </div><div>First, it represents a significant change in the way Windows is deployed, using dynamic background deployment to enroll a device on a Windows network. The configuration is automated and there's minimal user interaction. Just one-time steps that a user completes on a status enrollment page, while Autopilot works in the background. In a short period of time, the device is fully configured and ready to go.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] Screen title: Benefits of Autopilot. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Autopilot represents a new paradigm in the way OS deployment is performed, and that has some key benefits. First, it reduces the time and consequent cost of what, in the past, has been a time consuming and often awkward process. Deployments, especially on a mass scale, had to be prepared, images had to be created, scripts written and scheduled. That model has become obsolete with Autopilot.</div><div> </div><div>It's a simple process for the user because their settings, apps, preferences, and permissions are all contained in Azure Active Directory. And through Intune, Autopilot pushes them to the device. All the user has to do is interact with an enrollment page while everything is configured for them in the background. Needless to say, this significantly simplifies IT. And Autopilot ensures that the new device has all the latest updates.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Adding Devices with Autopilot</strong></h2><div>In this video, I'll discuss Windows Autopilot and demonstrate how to access Windows Autopilot device enrollment through the Azure Portal.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] A Microsoft 365 web page opens in a browser. The following tabs are present at the top: Windows, Microsoft Azure, Visual Studio, etc. There are three options in the top left side: Microsoft 365, Get started, and Add Autopilot devices and profile. There are five options in the top right side: Feedback, Edit, Share, Dark, and Sign in. There is a left pane. It has the following options: Manage, Migrate to Microsoft 365 Business, Add Autopilot devices and prof?ile, etc. Currently, the Add Autopilot devices and prof?ile is selected. The page heading is: Use the step-by-step guide to add Autopilot devices and profile. It has a section titled Device requirements. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>With Windows Autopilot, you can add devices that will eventually be connected and configured to your organization's network. There's little work that users have to do because Autopilot works in the background with Intune and Azure Active Directory to configure devices once the user has signed on for the first time using their Azure AD credentials.</div><div> </div><div>You can configure Windows Autopilot to deploy Windows 10 on earlier Windows devices, specifically running either Windows 7 or 8. You can reset devices. You can assign a self-deployment mode for automatic configuration of devices that have no user, for example, say a kiosk. And you can assign a user-driven mode, so users can configure the device during initial setup. Administrators should love Autopilot, because when they use it to enroll devices in Intune, they can configure every aspect of the user system, including what apps they have, their privileges, and their settings.</div><div> </div><div>The admin simply creates a CSV file, comma separated values, that contain the information for that system profile and imports it when adding devices in Windows Autopilot. The CSV file contains three columns. The first is the device serial number, the second the Windows product ID, and the third is the hardware hash for the device.</div><div> </div><div>Microsoft offers a PowerShell script that you can use to get the hardware properties from existing Windows 10 machines that you'll need for Autopilot deployment. You can locate this script by searching for get-windowsautopilotinfo, all one word. There's also this step-by-step guide that you can use at Microsoft's site, that ends with add-autopilot-devices-and-<wbr>profile, which you can get to easily by performing a web search, just omit the dashes. Now to access Autopilot and add new devices, navigate to <a href="http://portal.azure.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://portal.azure.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1761448071143000&amp;usg=AOvVaw36L8ebRlSIMQUYWo6k_RHm" rel="noopener">portal.azure.com</a>.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] In the address bar, he types <a href="http://portal.azure.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://portal.azure.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1761448071143000&amp;usg=AOvVaw36L8ebRlSIMQUYWo6k_RHm" rel="noopener">portal.azure.com</a>. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>And if you haven't signed in yet, enter your Microsoft 365 credentials.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] A Microsoft Azure Sign in page opens. An input box is present to enter Email, phone, or Skype. A Next button is present at the bottom. In the Email, phone, or Skype input box, he types. He clicks the Next button. A Microsoft Azure Enter password page opens. An input box is present to enter the password. A Sign in button is present. He types the password in the Password input box. He clicks the Sign in button. A Stay signed in page appears. A check box is present for Don't show this again. No and Yes buttons are present. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>And just to simplify things, I'll just stay signed in. So, Don't show this again, and select Yes.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] He selects the Don't show this again check box. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>And then I'll tell Edge that, yes, I want to save that password.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] He clicks the Yes button. A Microsoft Azure web page opens. It has a menu bar with a search box and the following options: Filter, Notifications, Settings, etc. A navigation pane is also present on this screen. The options here are: Create a resource, Home, Dashboard, All Services, and Favorites. The main body of the page has a section titled Azure services. Some of the options here are: Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, App Services, etc. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>If you're using a system that you know is trusted and not going to be accessed by anybody else, that's a safe thing to do. Okay, so here we are at the Azure portal. And in the very top search box, just type in, click and type in, intune.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] In the search box at the top, he types intune. Under the Services category, the following options appear: Intune, Intune App Protection, Intune for Education, etc. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Now the very first result under Services is Intune, so I'll click that. And that takes us to the Microsoft Intune page.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] He clicks on Intune. A new page titled Microsoft Intune opens. There is a left pane with a search box and the following options: Overview, Quick start, Manage, etc. In the center pane, the heading is Status. There are three sections: Device compliance status, Device assignment error, and Device assignment failure. In the Device compliance status, a table is displayed with two columns: Status and Devices. The following text is present: Enroll devices to view insights. The Device assignment error is 0. The Device assignment failure is 0. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>So we can see some information here. There are no devices assigned yet. And there's not much to look at, that's our Overview. We also have a Quick start option in the left-hand pane under Microsoft Intune.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] In the left pane, he clicks on Quick start. A new page titled Microsoft Intune - Quick start opens. The center pane has three sections: Overview, Get started, and Learn more. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>That helps us with some links that we can use to get started with working with Intune. And that's something you'll probably want to do if you're new to Intune and just getting up and running. But just very basically, to give you an idea of how devices get enrolled, what we can do here is click on Device enrollment in the Manage section of Intune.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] In the left pane, under Manage, he clicks on Device enrollment. A new page titled Device enrollment opens. The following details are present: Tenant name, Tenant location, MDM authority, and Account status. There are two tabs: Alerts and Enrollment Status. Currently, the Alerts tab is selected. One item is present: Apple. Next to it, in a box, the following text is present: Push certificate expiring - 946 days. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>And that pane has changed. Now we have some options under Manage for Apple enrollment, Android, Windows enrollment, Terms and conditions, restrictions, Device categories, Corporate device identifiers, and Device enrollment managers.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] He hovers over the options present under Manage in the left pane. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>And if we scroll down a bit, we'll see more under Monitor and Help and Support.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] He scrolls down the left pane. It has two more sections: Monitor and Help and support. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Now all I want to do is just basically show you how you would enroll a device. You click on Windows Enrollment, and we have a bunch of options here for us available under General.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] In the left pane, under Manage, he clicks on Windows enrollment. A new page titled Device enrollment - Windows enrollment opens. There is a section titled General. The following options are present: Automatic Enrollment, Windows Hello for Business, CNAME Validation, etc. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Automatic Enrollment, Windows Hello for Business, CNAME Validation, Enrollment Status Page. And that's a preview of the service Microsoft is rolling out. But here, if I scroll down a bit more, we'll see Windows Autopilot Deployment Program.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] He scrolls down the page. A section titled Windows Autopilot Deployment Program appears. It has the following options: Deployment Profiles, Devices, lntune Connector for Active Directory (Preview), etc. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>And we have three options. Deployment Profiles, Devices, and Intune Connector for Active Directory, also a preview. Now if I click on Deployment Profiles, we'll see there's one profile here that I've created called User Deployment.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] In the Windows Autopilot Deployment Program section, he clicks on Deployment Profiles. A new page titled Windows Autopilot Deployment profiles opens. A + Create profile button is present at the top. A table is present. It has four columns: Name, Description, Join Type, and Assigned. One row of data is present in the table. The Name is User Deployment, Join Type is Azure AD joined, and Assigned is Yes. An ellipsis button is present at the end of the row. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>The join type is Azure AD joined, and has it been assigned, Yes. And I can actually click that and delete it if I want to.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] He clicks the ellipsis button at the end of the row. A Delete option appears. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Or I can create a new profile. I'll go ahead and click that.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] He clicks the + Create profile button. A new page titled Create profile opens. Input boxes are present to enter Name and Description. A toggle button is present for the following text: Convert all targeted devices to Autopilot. The toggle button has two options: Yes and No. Currently, No is selected. A drop-down list for Deployment mode is also present. By default, it is set as User-Driven. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>And then I can start entering information about the profile. And these profiles will be used for rolling out your deployments to devices. Now, I'll cancel that and I'll actually just go back in the Edge browser to the last page and just show you very quickly, Windows enrollment, and Devices, we'll click on that.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] He clicks the Back button at the top. The Device enrollment page is open. He clicks on Windows enrollment. The Device enrollment - Windows enrollment page opens. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] In the Windows Autopilot Deployment Program section, he clicks on Devices. A new page titled Windows Autopilot devices opens. Four buttons are present at the top: Sync, Filter, Import, and Refresh. A Search by serial number input box is present. A table is present. It has six columns: Serial Number, Manufacturer, Model, Group Tag, Profile Status, and Purchase Order. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Now here we can Import that CSV file that I was talking about.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] He clicks the Import button. A right pane titled Add Windows Autopilot devices appears. It reads: Import Windows Autopilot devices from a .CSV f?ile. Information on Formatting Requirements is also present. A browse button is present to Select a file. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>So there's a little helper information in the right-hand pane that tells us that we have some formatting requirements that include &lt;Serial Number&gt;, &lt;Windows Product ID&gt;, &lt;Hardware Hash&gt;, and then optionally, &lt;Group Tag&gt; as the fourth column. And there are 500 rows maximum allowed in this CSV file. And again, you can go to Microsoft and get that PowerShell script that you can use to create an inventory of your devices.</div><div> </div><div>Or you can manually edit them, but you do have to understand the different devices and their hardware IDs. And you can manually build that CSV file. It's just a basic text file with commas separating the values. And that's under the Import option. Now, assuming that I had a CSV file already ready, I could click on the blue folder icon and import that, and select it, and then import it. And it would import the profiles for that device. But that's generally a sense of how you add new devices through Windows Autopilot when you're working with the Azure Portal in Microsoft 365.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Upgrade Readiness</strong></h2><div>In this video, I'll discuss the features and elements of upgrade readiness for Windows 10.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] Screen title: Windows Upgrade Path. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>The paradigm of enterprise OS deployment has been to fight with images, scripts, drivers, errors, and compatibility issues. Upgrading compounded the issue, and pushing upgrades out to a network can be a cumbersome task for IT. Microsoft has vastly simplified the paradigm with Windows 10, releasing a group of tools called Upgrade Readiness, breaking down the process into three simple steps to success, plan, adopt, and let the user get to work.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] Screen title: Features of Upgrade Readiness. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Microsoft's put an impressive amount of thought and work into how Windows 10 can be deployed and upgraded. There was a time not long ago when upgrading represented a huge burden on IT, and Microsoft clearly recognized this. Four main features of Upgrade Readiness that make it such a welcome tool are agility, allowing IT to be nimble and reducing the burden on IT previously associated with upgrades.</div><div> </div><div>Compatibility, which is paramount to the upgrading process. And Microsoft has placed a great focus on ensuring compatibility between devices, drivers, and apps by providing guidance in ways to fix compatibility issues. The speed of upgrading has been a thorn in the side of IT departments for years, but Upgrade Readiness greatly reduces the time burden on IT for upgrades. And Upgrade Readiness supports every version of Windows from 7 onward, as well as Windows 10 upgrades, using Microsoft's Windows as a service model.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] Screen title: How Upgrade Readiness Works. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Basically the way Upgrade Readiness works is to create an inventory of a system collecting information that can be used in the upgrade process. Locate any compatibility issues before an upgrade is performed. And provide IT admins with guidance so they can make any necessary fixes in advance of the upgrade.</div><div> </div><div>Upgrade Readiness streamlines upgrades by providing admins with a complete list of assets on the network, a visual workflow of a start to end solution. A roadmap, basically so admins can plan out their deployment. And any pertinent information on app usage, including a workflow, that admins can use to track their progress.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Windows 10 Licensing</strong></h2><div>In this video, I'll discuss Windows 10 licensing options, including access to Windows 10 Enterprise, Windows Virtual Desktop access, and Windows To Go.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] A Windows 10 Licensing web page is open in a browser. The following tabs are present at the top: Product Licensing, Licensing Programs, More, etc. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Windows 10 licensing offers unprecedented flexibility for organizations that want to liberate their IT deployments. With the ability to deploy to desktops, laptops, and tablets, you can implement a seamless user experience across the breadth of your organization. Windows has never been more compatible or more flexible. With this deployment model, you no longer have to fiddle with images to quickly deploy Windows, settings, and apps, simplifying IT for your organization.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] He scrolls down the page. Three tabs are present: Unique Software Assurance benefits, How to Buy, and Qualifying operating systems. Currently, the Unique Software Assurance benefits tab is open. There is a section titled Flexible access to Windows Enterprise. A table with five columns is present here. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Microsoft's Software Assurance provides easy access to Windows Enterprise across an organization alongside Windows Virtual Desktop Access, or VDA, which allows devices to connect and get up and running with a licensed Windows 10 and Office 365. Now, this table outlines the benefits of Windows Software Assurance on a per user and per device basis.</div><div> </div><div>So users can access Windows Enterprise using Software Assurance and VDA. And you can perform local installs on licensed devices, including Windows tablets with the screen size of 10.1 inches or smaller, and have remote access through Microsoft's Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, or VDI. Or with Windows To Go, a service in Windows 10 Enterprise and Education that allows you to boot into a Windows 10 workspace from a USB drive, regardless of the OS installed on the PC. Now, moving down a bit, under Software Assurance benefits, there are three categories.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] He scrolls down the page. A section titled Software Assurance benefits appears. There are three options: Sign in to the Volume Licensing Service Center, Volume Activation and Product Keys, and Contact a Partner. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>They're indicated by clickable icons. The monitor icon takes you to the sign in for the Volume Licensing Service Center. The clipboard icon takes you to support information for Volume Activation and Product Keys. And you can click the icon of a person wearing a badge to contact a Microsoft partner and begin the process of purchasing Windows 10 licenses.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Deployment Planning</strong></h2><div>In this video, I'll discuss Microsoft resources for planning a deployment of Windows 10 in an Enterprise environment.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] A Plan for Windows 10 deployment web page is open in a browser. The following tabs are present at the top: Explore, Docs, Downloads, Scripts, etc. There are three options in the top left side: Docs, Windows, and Deployment. There are five options in the top right side: Feedback, Edit, Share, Theme, and Sign in. There is a left pane. It has the following options: Plan for Windows 10 deployment, Windows 10 Enterprise FAQ for IT Pros, Windows 10 deployment considerations, etc. Currently, the first option is selected. The page heading is: Plan for Windows 10 deployment. It has a section titled In this section. Under In this section, a table is present which has two columns: Topic and Description. The table has six topics. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>When you're planning for a Windows deployment, Microsoft offers a wealth of information that can guide you through the process of determining your needs, understanding the requirements, and ultimately getting up and running. You can find this page by performing a web search using the title plan for Windows 10 deployment, it should be the first search result. On this page, you'll find six topics that can assist you in the process. The first is frequently asked questions for IT professionals interested in knowing more about Windows 10 Enterprise.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] He talks about the first topic: Windows 10 Enterprise: FAQ for IT professionals. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>This covers hardware requirements for Windows 10 where you can download Windows 10 Enterprise, and information for evaluating Windows 10 Enterprise. It also digs into drivers, application, and device compatibility, deployment tools, information for upgrading from Windows 7 or Windows 8 to Windows 10. Managing updates, and Windows as a service, and information about features and changes in Windows 10 and how the user experience with Windows 10 is affected on an organizational level.</div><div> </div><div>The second link takes you to a page that deals with Windows 10 deployment considerations including elimination of the need for images with in place automated upgrades and dynamic provisioning for organizations. It also includes information for migrating from previous versions of Windows, setting up new computers, and how to stay up to date with Windows 10. The third link covers Windows 10 compatibility issues, including recommendations for testing applications with Windows 10.</div><div> </div><div>The fourth link covers Windows 10 infrastructure requirements including deployment tools, management tools, and Windows activation. The fifth link deals with Windows To Go, which is Microsoft's new feature in Windows 10 Enterprise and Education editions. It allows you to create Windows 10 sessions on a USB drive that can be used on any PC, regardless of the installed OS, provided that the hardware is compatible with at least Windows 7. And finally, there's a technical reference link for the application compatibility toolkit or ACT, which is part of the Microsoft Operations Management Suite. It empowers you to analyze your existing hardware and software to ensure that your setup is compatible for Windows 10 deployment.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>What is Azure?</strong></h2><div>In this video I'll discuss Microsoft Azure, what it is, and reasons to adopt Azure, including Azure's free offering. Launched in 2010, Azure is Microsoft's cloud hosting service. Designed for building, managing, and deploying enterprise apps, and much much more, Azure is hosted through Microsoft's data centers around the world. Microsoft's data centers are strategically placed across the globe. And Azure offers a full range of cloud services, including software as a service, infrastructure as a service, and platform as a service.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] Software as a service is abbreviated as SaaS. Infrastructure as a service is abbreviated as IaaS. Platform as a service is abbreviated as PaaS. Screen title: Reasons to Adopt Azure. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>There are plenty of reasons to adopt Azure, and here are just a few. First, it's a secure platform with state-of-the-art security. It's a flexible solution for organizations that want to deploy their IT to the cloud, implement a hybrid cloud in concert with their own infrastructure, or simply create a cloud-based development environment. With Azure, you get to choose the tools and services you use. And it's a very cost-effective solution, with options to suit businesses from the very small to the very large. Even better, it's free to try, and Microsoft has invested a great deal into the trust relationship required for organizations that wish to adopt a cloud solution.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] Screen title: Azure Free to Try. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>So let's delve into Azure's free offering for a moment. Microsoft has chosen to make Azure free for those who wish to sign up for its services with 12 months of certain free services, a monetary credit so you can try out paid Azure services for 30 days. And more than 25 services that will always be free, whether or not you commit to an Azure paid plan. There will be no charge to you until you choose to upgrade to Azure's paid services.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Azure Features</strong></h2><div>In this video, I'll discuss the key features of Microsoft Azure, including load balancing, availability, and performance.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] Screen title: Features of Azure. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Microsoft Azure is a hosted cloud solution that provides options for organizations including software as a service, infrastructure as a service, and platform as a service. It has many attractive features and at the top of the list is Microsoft's security, testing and deployment, data insights through analytics, and mobility solutions.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] Screen title: Load Balancer. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Availability will never be a problem with Azure. It's designed for the kind of high availability and high performance required by enterprises using load balancing. Load balancing is a technique that allocates traffic to different resources so as not to create bottlenecks. And with Azure, this is achieved through Azure virtual machines that share the incoming data load and ensure that there's high availability and performance, regardless of the current traffic demand.</div><div> </div><div>[Video description begins] Screen title: Storage Features of Azure. [Video description ends]</div><div> </div><div>Azure is highly flexible and there are three storage features of Azure that I'd like to talk about. First is managed disks, which is an Azure feature that uses virtual hard disks. And while the storage is still on actual hard disks in an Azure data center, managed disks are actually data objects known as blobs.</div><div> </div><div>What's great about managed disks is that they're created and managed for you by Azure. And while easy to access, they offer high availability and scalability. I've mentioned VMs already as they pertain to load balancing. But with Azure VMs, you can create virtualized environments for practically any platform. For example, a SQL server, a Linux server, Oracle, Windows server, you name it.
