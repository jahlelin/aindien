This small study book is ideal for middle school or high school students.</a></p><h2><strong>Creating a table</strong></h2><div>Tables can be used to analyze and present data that you want to include in your Word document. If you want to begin using tables, you are going to need to know how to create one and insert your data. I have a document open and I want to insert a table. To do this, I'll first click below the graph to choose my insertion point, and then I click on the Insert tab, and in the Tables toolset I click on Table. This opens up a menu, and I can hover my mouse over the grid lines to choose the size of the table and view a preview in the document. I can also click on Insert Table from the menu to open up the Insert Table window.</div><div> </div><div>I can choose the Table size. The number of columns is currently set to 5, but with the number selected I can easily insert a new number by using my keyboard - I'll type in 7. [Video description begins] The number of columns is set to 5, and the number of rows is set to 2. [Video description ends] And for the number of rows it's currently set to 2, but I can easily change that by clicking on the up arrow to 3. You can also choose the AutoFit behavior. You can choose between Fixed column width, AutoFit to contents, and AutoFit to window. I'll leave it on Fixed column width for now.</div><div> </div><div>Lastly, you can check Remember dimensions for a new table if you want to remember the number of columns and rows to quickly insert another table, but I'll leave that unchecked for now. I click OK to close the window and insert the table. Notice that with the table now inserted into the document, two new tabs have appeared. The Table Design tab is where you can, for example, apply table styles and borders, and the Layout tab is where you can, for example, draw a table or sort the data.</div><div> </div><div>To insert data into a table, click into a cell to activate the cursor - I'll click into the first one - and then use your keyboard to type. I'll type in the word "Materials". Then, you can use your arrow keys to move within the table. For example, I can press the down arrow key to move down or the right arrow key to move right, and then I can press the up arrow key to go back into the same row and type in another word.</div><div> </div><div>I'll type in "Design". There are also other options to insert tables. First, I'll click below the table to select a new insertion point, and then I click on the Insert tab, and I click on Table to open up the menu. I can choose to draw a table, insert an Excel spreadsheet, or I can hover my mouse over Quick Tables to open up a gallery. I can browse the gallery by using the scroll bar on the right side of the menu, and I can insert a table by clicking on it. I'll click on Tabular List, and the table has now been inserted. Lastly, you can convert text into a table and a table into text.</div><div> </div><div>I'll scroll down a bit so that we can view the list. I separated the list by pressing the Tab key between the items and the number, and the Enter key to start a new line. To convert text into a table, first select the text by clicking and dragging with your mouse, and then I click on the Insert tab, and I click on Table to open the menu, and then I click on Convert Text to Table. This opens up the Convert Text to Table window, where I can choose the table size, and it's automatically set to the number of columns and rows you have in your list.</div><div> </div><div>So it is currently set to 2 columns, which I can change by increasing or decreasing, and the number of rows which is set to 8, because there are eight items in the list. For now, I'll leave those both the same. You can also choose the AutoFit behavior, and I will leave it as Fixed column width; and you can 'Separate the text at' and I'll leave it at 'Tabs' because that is how I separated the text. I then click OK to close the window, and the text has now been converted to a table.</div><div> </div><div>To convert the table into text, first select the table. Mine is already selected because it is highlighted in gray, or you can click on the handle in the top left of the table. Then, click on the Table Layout tab, and in the Data toolset, click on Convert to Text. The Convert Table to Text window opens, where I can choose how I want the text to be separated. I'll leave it at Tabs, and then I click OK to close the window, and the table has now been converted back to text.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Inserting &amp; deleting items in a table</strong></h2><div>Once you have inserted your table, you can change its appearance, style and format. In Word, you can add data to your table by inserting new rows and columns. You can also delete rows, columns and even the entire table with a single click. I have a document open with a table already inserted with data. I can insert additional columns by hovering my mouse over any of the lines separating the rows and columns, and a small plus sign will appear, and clicking on it will add another column to the right side of the table.</div><div> </div><div>We can do the same by hovering our mouse in the bottom left corner, for example, and clicking on the plus sign to insert another row. If you would like to insert multiple columns, select the columns by clicking when a black arrow appears and you can click and drag to select multiple columns. Then in the Table Layout tab and in the Rows &amp;amp; Columns toolset, you can click on Insert Left to insert three columns to the left.</div><div> </div><div>Note that the same number of columns will be inserted, so in this case three columns were selected and three more were inserted. You can do the same to insert multiple rows. You could click on Insert Below or Insert Above, or you can select the rows by clicking and dragging with the black arrow, and when you release a mini toolbar appears. Then you can click on Insert, which opens up a menu, and I can click on Insert Below, and now more rows have been inserted.</div><div> </div><div>Now I'll click away to deselect everything. Now that we have many columns and rows, we may want to delete some. To delete a column, select the column you want to delete with the black arrow, and then in the Layout tab and in the Rows &amp;amp; Columns toolset, click on Delete. This opens up a menu where I click Delete Columns, and the column has now been deleted. Again, the same action can be performed to delete a row. To delete multiple rows or columns, for example we will delete multiple rows, select the rows by clicking and dragging and then from the mini toolbar, with the Insert and Delete options, I click on Delete and then I click Delete Rows from the menu.</div><div> </div><div>And now the rows have been deleted. If you would like to insert cells, select the cell. For example, I'll select this blank cell and right click on it. I can hover my mouse over Insert from the menu where we have options to insert the cell. Clicking on that option opens the Insert Cells window, where I have the options to shift the cells down, right, or insert an entire row or column. I'll shift the cells down, so I click OK and the cells have been shifted down.</div><div> </div><div>To remove cells, select the cell and from the mini toolbar click on Delete, and from the menu click on Delete Cells. This opens up the Delete Cells window, where I can choose to Shift cells left, Shift cells up, Delete entire row or Delete entire column. I'll choose to shift the cells up, and then click OK to close the window and apply the changes. To delete the entire table, activate the cursor in a cell and then in the Layout tab and in the Rows &amp;amp; Columns toolset, I can click on Delete. But it is also possible to select the table by clicking on the handle in the left corner and using the mini toolbar to press Delete, or by pressing the backspace key. I'll press the backspace key, and the table has now been deleted.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Resizing your table, rows and columns</strong></h2><div>Once you have inserted your table, you can begin to edit it. You can, for example, resize your columns and merge cells. Word features lots of tools that can help you to structure and format your table. You can also choose whether to adjust your column and row sizes individually or proportionately. I have a Word document open and tables already inserted, and the ruler is also activated. I can manually resize the height of a row and a column by hovering my mouse over a line separating the rows, and when the cursor changes to an opposite facing arrows icon, you can simply drag the line to resize the height. So I can drag it down to make it larger, or I can drag it up to make it smaller.</div><div> </div><div>You can do the same for the columns, when the cursor changes to an opposite facing arrows icon you can simply drag to the left to make the column larger or to the right to make this column smaller. If you have the ruler activated, you can drag to resize the column and hold down the Alt key to view the exact dimensions. For example, we can make the column four centimeters wide. To set a value for the height of multiple rows or columns, we can select the column with the black arrow, and then in the Layout tab and in the Cell Size toolset, you can set the values for the width and the height.</div><div> </div><div>For example, if I want to increase the width of the column, I can use the up arrow to increase the width to make it larger. You can also select the whole column by clicking on the handle in the top left corner of the table, and you can change the width for the whole table. For example, I can type in 5, and now the columns are five centimeters wide and the height can be 2, and now the rows are two centimeters tall. You can also distribute rows and columns. Next to the row height and the column width fields, I can click on Distribute Rows and I can click on Distribute Columns.</div><div> </div><div>And now the rows and columns are distributed evenly. Lastly, in the Cell Size toolset is the AutoFit options. I can click to open the menu where we have the options to AutoFit Contents, AutoFit Window, or Fixed Column Width. Now that the columns and rows have been resized, you can manually resize a table.</div><div> </div><div>I'll scroll down a bit, and at the bottom right of the table, the arrow changes to a double sided arrow where you can drag it out or in to change the size of the table. To access the table properties, activate the cursor in any cell and then in the Layout tab and in the Table toolset, I click on Properties. This opens up the Table Properties window, and I will just drag it to the right so that we can better view the document. In the Table tab, I can set a value for the size.</div><div> </div><div>I'll check Preferred width, and I will enter 12 cm by using my keyboard. Then you could also choose the alignment and texture wrapping, but we will leave those the same for now. I can now click on the Rows tab to view the current row size. I can navigate through the rows by clicking on Next Row or Previous Row. The selected row is highlighted in the table and you can change the height for the specific row. So, for example, in this row it is currently 1.77 cm.</div><div> </div><div>I can increase the height by clicking on the up arrow and making it 2.7 cm. I can click on the Column tab, and just like with rows, I can view the width as well as navigate between the columns by clicking on the Previous or Next Column, as well as applying specific sizes depending on the column. So this column is currently 2.34 cm, which I can increase to 3.1 cm. Then I click OK to apply the changes and close the window, and now the changes have been applied to the table.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Aligning the text in your table</strong></h2><div>You can improve the appearance of the data you have inserted into your Word table by using the formatting tools. You can, for example, apply text effects to make your column and row header stand out and even adjust the alignment and margin settings for individual cells. I have a document open with a table and data that needs to be formatted better. In Word, you can change the text direction of a group of cells.</div><div> </div><div>To do this, I'll first select the cells. I will click on the top of the first column with the black arrow, and then in the Layout tab and in the Alignment toolset, I click on Text Direction and the text has been rotated to be vertical. You can click on it as many times until you find your preferred rotation.</div><div> </div><div>I will make it the horizontal direction. I can also align content in a table. Currently, the table has many different alignments. For example, the column with description has the title aligned to the right, while the rest of the column is aligned to the left. I can select the first half of the table by clicking and dragging with the black arrow to select a group of cells, and then I click on the Home tab, and in the Paragraph toolset, I can click on the different alignment tools.</div><div> </div><div>So I can align the text to the left, I can center the text, I can align the text to the right, or I can justify the text. You can also access alignment text options for the tables. To do so, I click on the Layout tab and in the Alignment toolset there are nine options. To apply alignment for a group of cells, I'll select the second half of the table by clicking and dragging with the black arrow, and then I simply click on any of the options.</div><div> </div><div>For example, I can click on Align Bottom Left or Align Top Center. I can also select the whole table by clicking on the handle in the top left of the table and click on some more options. So I can align it to the top left or align it to the center. Now that the text has been aligned, we can set up default cell margins and spacing. To access cell margin options, under the Layout tab and in the Alignment toolset, I can click on Cell Margins. This opens up the Table Options window. To set up default cell margins, you can use the arrow buttons to adjust the margins or enter in values using your keyboard.</div><div> </div><div>For example, let's increase Top to .25, and let's increase Bottom to .2, and we can use our keyboard to type in Left to .1 and Right to .1. Then in the Default cell spacing section, we can check Allow spacing between cells, and it is already set to .04, but let's increase it to .1. In the Options section, 'Automatically resize to fit contents' is already checked, so we will leave it there for now. Then I click OK to apply the changes and close the window.</div><div> </div><div>And now the default values have been applied to the table. I can click away to deselect the table, and then click on the plus arrow to insert a row, and the default values have been applied to the new row. If you'd like to customize cell margins and spacing for a group of cells, select the cells - I'll select the second row - and then under the Layout tab and in the Cell Size toolset, I click on the dialog box launcher to open up the Table Properties window, and then I click on the Cell tab to access the Size and the Vertical alignment.</div><div> </div><div>In addition, I can also click on the Options button to open up the Cell Options window. In the Cell margin section, currently 'Same as the whole table' is checked. I can uncheck it to access the values for top, bottom, left and right. Again, we can use the arrow buttons to change the values, or we can type it in by using our keyboard.</div><div> </div><div>Let's type in .5 for all of the options. In the Options section, you have the choice between Wrap text and Fit text. Wrap text is currently checked, so we'll will leave it for now. Then I click OK to close the Cell Options window, and I click OK to close the Table Properties window and apply the changes.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Adjusting your table layout</strong></h2><div>The table that you've inserted into your Word document can be moved around. You can adjust the alignment settings and how it interacts with the text. I have a table already inserted in my Word document. I can move a table within a document, I can hover my mouse over the table, and on the top left corner, a handle appears.</div><div> </div><div>With the multi arrow cursor, I can drag the table up or down. Dragging it down will automatically scroll. Notice that the table interacts with the surrounding text just like an image, and the dotted box acts as a guide to help place the table in your document. Once you're happy with where the guide is, you can release your mouse and your table has been inserted, and the text has been moved down. I can also adjust the alignment and the position of a table.</div><div> </div><div>To change the layout options for a table, right click any cell to open up a menu. From the menu, click on Table Properties. This opens up the Table Properties window and the Table tab. Here, you can choose the Size, Alignment - let's choose center; and Text wrapping - let's choose none. Then I click OK to apply the changes and close the window. Lastly, I can customize the alignment and position of a table. First, I can access the table options by clicking on the Layout tab, and in the Table toolset, I can click on Properties.</div><div> </div><div>Again, the Table Properties window opens, and notice that 'Indent from left' is grayed out. To activate it, click on Left alignment and then you can set a value by clicking on the up arrow to increase it to 1, for example. I can also customize the text wrapping options. Notice that the positioning button is also grayed out. To activate it click on Around, and now you can click on Positioning.</div><div> </div><div>This opens up the Table Positioning window, where I can set values for Horizontal. We can set the position. It's currently set to Left, I'll click on the down arrow to open the menu and choose Center. Then I can choose Relative to. I'll click on the down arrow and choose Page. Then I can set the Vertical option. Under Position, I can click on the down arrow to open the menu and choose Inside. And then Relative to, I can click on the arrow to open the menu and we'll leave it with Margin.</div><div> </div><div>In the Distance from surrounding text option, we can set the values. For example, I'll click on the up arrow for Top and increase it to .75. I can increase the bottom to .5, and I can change Left by typing on my keyboard. We'll change it to .25. And Right, we'll change it to .2. In the Options section, there are the choices to Move with text and Allow overlap.</div><div> </div><div>I'll check Allow overlap. Then I click OK to close the Table Positioning window, and then I click OK to close the Table Properties window. I'll just scroll down a bit, and now we have successfully customized the alignment and position of a table.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Merging and splitting tables</strong></h2><div>Once you have added data to your table, you may find that you want to combine or separate cells. For example, this can be useful, especially if the data falls under the same column. In addition, you can manage long tables by configuring repeated headers. I have a document with a table open in Word. In the table, there are some cells that can be merged to better represent the data. To merge cells from different columns, first select the cells you want to merge. I will merge Materials and Equipment. I can select them by clicking and dragging with the black arrow, and then I click on the Layout tab, and in the Merge toolset, I click on Merge Cells, and the cells have now been successfully merged.</div><div> </div><div>You can also merge cells from different rows. Again, select the cells that you want to merge. With the black arrow, I will click and drag to select Construction, Refitting and Installation, and this time I can right click to open up the menu and then click on Merge Cells, and the cells have been merged. If you would like to split merged cells, make sure to select the cells first.</div><div> </div><div>I will select the Materials and Equipment cell that we just merged, and then in the Layout tab and in the Merge toolset, I can click on Split Cells. The Split Cells window opens with the options to change the number of columns and the number of rows. I'm happy with what the numbers are, so I'll click OK and the cell has been split. With the double-sided arrow, I can drag the line to the right to realign the column.</div><div> </div><div>Word also allows you to split tables. This can be handy if you have added too much information for one table, or the data would be better understood separately. To split a table, click to position the cursor anywhere in the row that you want to be the first row of the table. I will click before the word "Materials". Then in the Layout tab and in the Merge toolset, I click on Split Table. The active row now becomes the header of the new table. The new table may appear over the first table, but you can simply reposition it by hovering your cursor over the first table, and with the handle on the left corner of the table, click and drag to move it up.</div><div> </div><div>And now the two tables are clearly visible. You can also copy and paste the original header to the additional table by selecting the original header with the black arrow, and then using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C to copy it, then click on the first cell of the new table, and if you want to keep the text in this row, then you must insert a row above. In the Rows &amp;amp; Columns toolset, click on Row Above. Then in the new row, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+V to paste the header.</div><div> </div><div>I can just scroll down a bit, and you may notice that the table is split onto two pages. For long tables appearing in different pages, you can configure repeated headers. First, I'll scroll back up and I'll activate the cursor in the first row. Then I will right click to open up the menu. In the menu, I click on Table Properties, which opens up the Table Properties window. Under the Table tab and in the Text wrapping section, make sure that text wrapping is set to None, and then in the Row tab and in the Options section, check 'Repeat as header row at the top of each page'.</div><div> </div><div>Then click OK to apply the changes and close the window. I can scroll down and confirm that the header has been repeated to the next page. If you would like to deactivate the repeated headers, scroll back up and click into the header, then in the Layout tab and the Data toolset, click on Repeat Header Rows. Now I can scroll back down and confirm that the header is no longer repeated.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Formatting your table</strong></h2><div>As with many other items in Word, you can add color to the data that you have added to your table. You can change the color of your cells outline, background and even contents. I have a Word document open. Now that the table and data are inserted, I would like to format the table. I first want to change the font. To do this, I can hover my mouse over the table to activate the handle in the top left corner of the table. I can click on the handle to select the entire table. From the mini toolbar, I can click on the down arrow next to the Font field to open up the font gallery. I can choose a new font.</div><div> </div><div>Let's choose Arial, and now the entire table has been changed to Arial. And now the font for the entire table has been changed to Arial. I'll click away to deselect the text and close the mini toolbar. You can also select separate cells. For example, I want to make all of the text in the white cells stand out. We can make the changes all at once, even with the column that is colored between them. First, select the first column by clicking and dragging with the black arrow, then to select the second group of columns, hold down the Ctrl and Shift keys on your keyboard, and then with the black arrow, click and drag.</div><div> </div><div>Now, under the Home tab and in the Font toolset, we can apply different changes to the selected cells. For example, let's apply Bold and Underline to the text. In addition, you can use a select tool to select a row. For example, let's format the table header. I'll click into the first cell to activate the cursor. Then, I click on the Layout tab, and in the Table toolset, I click on Select. This opens up a menu where I can choose to select the cell, the column, the row or the table.</div><div> </div><div>I'll choose Select Row, and the header row has now been selected. Then I can apply some changes by clicking on the Home tab, and in the Font toolset we can apply bold, we can increase the size and we can change the font. A quick way to format a table and its content is to apply a table style. To access the Table Styles gallery, click on the Table Design tab and in the Table Styles toolset we have the Table Styles gallery. I can hover my mouse over any of the options to show a live preview in the document, or I can click on the More arrow to view more styles.</div><div> </div><div>In addition, I can also modify table styles, clear or add new table styles. To access more options for a table style, I can right click on any style to open up a menu where I can choose Apply and Clear Formatting, Apply and Maintain Formatting, New Table Style, Modify Table Style, Delete Table Style, Set as Default, or Add Gallery to Quick Access Toolbar. I will choose Apply and Clear Formatting, and now the table style has been applied to the table. In addition, you can also apply shading options. With the header still selected, I can click on the Shading tool to open up the menu where I can choose Theme Colors, Standard Colors, No Color or More Colors.</div><div> </div><div>I'll choose a theme color, and I'll click away to deselect the text. Now a shading color has been applied to the header. Now I'll click on a cell to reactivate the Table Design tab, and in the Table Style Options, you can check the options to activate and deactivate the table style options. For example, checking Last Column changes the appearance of the last column in the table. Notice that the changes are also being applied to the Table Styles gallery. Lastly, you can remove a table style.</div><div> </div><div>To do so, re-open the gallery and then at the bottom of the menu, click on Clear. To remove remaining customizations such as font and text effects, click on the handle to select the table and then click on the Home tab, and in the Font toolset, click on Clear All Formatting. And now the formatting has been cleared from the table.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Adjusting your table borders</strong></h2><div>Another way of improving the appearance of your table is to adjust your border settings. In Word, you can edit individual cell borders, adjusting the line width, style and color. I have a document open. I have already inserted my table and now I want to apply borders to the table. To do this, I'll hover my mouse over the table and then click on the handle in the top left of the corner. Now that the table is selected, you can find the border options under the Home tab, and in the Paragraph toolset you have the Borders tool, or I can click on the Table Design tab and in the Borders toolset, I can click on Borders to open up the menu.</div><div> </div><div>I can hover the mouse over borders to get a preview. I will apply All Borders, and now all of the cells have a border on all sides. You can also change the border for a specific cell. If you would like to remove borders for a cell or group of cells, click into the cell or select the cells with the black arrow - I will select the header row - and re-open the Borders menu to uncheck the borders.</div><div> </div><div>In this case, I want to remove the Top Border, the Left Border, the Right Border, and the Inside Border. Remember that we have to open the menu each time we want to uncheck a border. In addition, you can also change the border style. To change the outside border style of the table, select the table by clicking on the handle, and then in the Table Design tab and in the Borders toolset, you can click on Border Styles. This opens up a menu with the Theme Borders and the Recently Used Borders.</div><div> </div><div>I can click on a border from the theme. Then I can open up the Line Style menu, and I can choose a line style. Then I can open up the Weight menu and choose a line weight. And finally, I can open up the Pen Color menu where I can choose from Theme Colors, Standard Colors or More Colors. I'll choose a theme color.</div><div> </div><div>Once you're happy with the settings, open the Borders menu and select Outside Border, and the border style has now been applied to the outside border of the table. To have more creative control over your tables, it is also useful to know how to customize a border. Before customizing specific borders, it may be suitable to display gridlines. To do this, open up the Borders menu and then click on View Gridlines. The gridline is the dotted line between the cells in the header row. To change individual borders, activate the Border Painter.</div><div> </div><div>Then, you can choose a border style, a line style, a line weight, and a pen color. Then you can draw the borders with your paintbrush cursor. This is very useful to add a border or to replace one. You can also copy a customized border style. To do this, click on Border Styles, and at the bottom of the menu, click on Border Sampler. With a dropper icon cursor, select a border you want to copy.</div><div> </div><div>I'll select the outside border. With your paintbrush cursor, you can select where you want the border to be. I'll make it down the middle and below the first row. And now the customized style was copied and applied to other cells borders.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Sorting the data in your table</strong></h2><div>If your table contains a lot of information, you can sort it using different criteria and change how you visualize your entries. In Word, you can even apply multiple sort criteria simultaneously. I have a document open with a table and data already inserted. Now that the values are in the table, I want to sort the data. For example, I can sort the Budget item column in alphabetical order. To access the sort options, click on the handle in the top left corner of the table, and then in the Layout tab and in the Data toolset, click on Sort.</div><div> </div><div>This opens up the Sort window where you can 'Sort by' and 'Then by' two times, meaning you can sort with further information. At the bottom of the window is the section for 'My list has'. You can choose between Header row and No header row. If your table has a header row, select the first option. It is important to let Word know if you have a header so that it is not included in the sorting. Then you can define other criteria for sorting the data.</div><div> </div><div>In the Sort by section, I can set a value by clicking on the down arrow, and since I want to sort the budget items in alphabetical order, I select Budget item. Then I select the type. I want it to be text using paragraphs. Then, since I want it in alphabetical order starting from the letter closest to A down to Z, I click Ascending. To sort by applying one criteria, make sure that the 'Then by' field does not contain any value.</div><div> </div><div>I can now click on the Options button to open up the Sort Options window. You have more options to configure how you like to sort. You can separate fields at tabs, commas or other, I'll leave it at commas for now, and you can choose to sort column only or sort case sensitive, meaning that it depends if the word is uppercase or lowercase. And you can also choose the sorting language. I'll leave everything the same for now, and I click OK to close the Sort Options window.</div><div> </div><div>Then I click OK to apply the changes to sort and close the Sort window. Now, the items in the Budget item column are sorted in alphabetical order, with the words starting with C in the beginning and the word starting with R at the end. If you would like to sort data with multiple criteria, click on Sort again to open up the Sort window, and then we can define how we'd like to sort by. This time, I'll open up the menu and click on Cost.</div><div> </div><div>The type then automatically changes to Number, and we'll still use Paragraphs. And 'Then by', we can click to open up the menu and we can choose what we would like to sort by next. We'll sort by Budget item. We will leave the Type and Using the same, as well as Ascending for both. Then I click OK to apply the changes and close the window. Now, the values in the Cost column are sorted from least expensive to most expensive.</div><div> </div><div>Notice that there are two of the same value. Sorting data with more criteria is useful when some data is repeated. For example, these two items cost the same amount, so they are sorted together. And since we specified further how to sort the data, it is also in alphabetical order.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Performing a calculation in your table</strong></h2><div>In Word, you can use a number of different functions to perform calculations with the data you have inserted into your table. This can be very useful if you want to return the subtotal of a number of entries in your table. Word doesn't have the advanced calculation features of Excel, but it is possible to use the data inside to perform some calculations. I currently have a document with a table open in Word. Just like in Excel, we can identify columns with a letter and rows with numbers. So starting at the first column, we have A, B, C, D and E, and starting with the first row, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</div><div> </div><div>So, for example, Quantity is in cell A1, while the blank cell next to Total is in cell E9. We could perform a basic calculation, such as calculating the total for the fourth row by first clicking into the cell and then click on the Layout tab, and in the data toolset I click on Formula. This opens up the Formula window with a default formula. [Video description begins] The default formula is: =SUM(ABOVE). [Video description ends] We can either use the default formula or we can manually insert a formula.</div><div> </div><div>I will delete the default formula by selecting it and pressing the Delete key, and then I will type in a formula. Every formula starts with an equal sign, and then to represent the quantity I will type in A4. Since I want to multiply it, that is represented as an asterisk symbol in Word, and then D4 to represent the price per unit. Then I click OK, and we have now calculated the total. We can also perform some more advanced calculations, such as calculating the subtotal and total for multiple values.</div><div> </div><div>First, I'll click into the cell next to subtotal, and then I will open up the Formula window again. I will delete the default formula, and then I'll type in the equal sign to start the formula. Since I'm adding the three items, I need to insert SUM by opening up the Paste function menu and using the scroll bar to scroll down through the menu and clicking on SUM.</div><div> </div><div>Then, between the parentheses, I can insert the range of cells. I enter E2, then to represent the range I use a colon, and then I enter in cell E4. Now all the cells in the range will be added. I click OK, and now we have a subtotal calculated. Lastly, I can add the total from the subtotal, VAT and P&amp;amp;P. I click in the blank cell next to Total, and then I open up the Formula window again.</div><div> </div><div>I delete the default formula, and then I type in = to start the formula, E6 to represent the subtotal, times which is represented by the asterisk, open parentheses,1+E7, close parentheses, to represent the VAT and to account that that is a percentage, then we have to add the P&amp;amp;P, so +E8. Then I click OK, and we now have the total calculated.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Inserting items from Excel</strong></h2><div>If you have already created a chart or table using a spreadsheet program, you can quickly transfer that data into your Word document. Once you have finished importing these items into your document, you can modify them. I have a spreadsheet open in Excel. I can paste data from the Excel file into my Word document by first clicking on a cell and then using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+A to select the entire spreadsheet.</div><div> </div><div>To copy the spreadsheet, I use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C, then I click on the Word icon in the taskbar to activate the Word document. I then click in the document to select my insertion point and use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+V. Using the handle, I will just move the table over a bit. It is important to note that when you directly paste the table in Word, any modification applied into the Excel file will not be reproduced in the Word document.</div><div> </div><div>With that being said, you can use the paste options to paste data and keep the link to the source data. I will click below the data and then press the Enter key and scroll down to the next page. Then, under the Home tab and in the Clipboard toolset, I can click on Paste, which opens up a menu with paste options. I can hover my mouse over the options to view how the data will be pasted into the document. I will then select an option that includes a link which is indicated by the link icon.</div><div> </div><div>Once again, I can hover my mouse over the table and use the handle to move it over a bit. I will click away to deselect the table, and then I'll click on the Excel icon in the taskbar to switch back to the Excel spreadsheet. Now I can click into the table. I will click into cell E3, select the text and type in "Homotic". I'll click into a different cell so that the change is recognized, then I'll switch back to the Word document. Now I will select the table by clicking on the handle, and I will right click the table.</div><div> </div><div>This opens up a menu where under the Link Worksheet Object, I can edit the link, open the link, Convert, and Links, as well as Update Link. I will click on Update Link, and then I'll move the table over a bit with the handle and can view that the cell E3 has been successfully updated in the Word document. Word table tools are also available for items copied from Excel. To customize the table, ensure that it is selected, then under the Table Design tab and in the Table Styles toolset, click on the More arrow to open up the gallery.</div><div> </div><div>I can choose any of the options to apply a style, and the style has been successfully applied. I'll now open up another document to insert a spreadsheet. To do so, I'll click on the File tab, and then I'll click on the New tab, and I'll click on Blank document. Now, with a blank document open in Word, I can insert a spreadsheet. I'll click into the document to select the insertion point, and then I click on the Insert tab, and in the Tables toolset I click on Table.</div><div> </div><div>This opens up a menu where I click on Excel Spreadsheet. Notice that the ribbon changes to match the Excel interface. To quickly insert data, click on the Excel icon in the taskbar, and then select some data that you want to copy. I will select the columns for first name and surname. Then I'll use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C and click back into our Word document, and in the first cell, A1, I can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+V to paste the information.</div><div> </div><div>Now I'll click outside of the spreadsheet to close the Excel interface. If you want to resize or move the spreadsheet, you can simply click on it and then use the handles to resize it. To delete the spreadsheet, select the spreadsheet and then press the Delete key on your keyboard. And now the spreadsheet has been deleted from your document.</div></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 11, 2025</p><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fusing-tables-in-word-365.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fusing-tables-in-word-365.html&amp;via=_Aindien&amp;text=Using%20tables%20in%20Word%20365" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://aindien.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://aindien.com/shaping-documents-in-word-365.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Shaping documents in Word 365</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://aindien.com/choosing-and-using-the-best-solution.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Choosing and Using the Best Solution </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-10-13T22:09" class="feed__date">October 13, 2025</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/choosing-and-using-the-best-solution.html" class="invert">Choosing and Using the Best Solution</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-10-11T22:11" class="feed__date">October 11, 2025</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/shaping-documents-in-word-365.html" class="invert">Shaping documents in Word 365</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-09-11T20:18" class="feed__date">September 11, 2025</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/using-the-desktop-environment-in-windows.html" class="invert">Using the Desktop Environment in Windows</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><style type="text/css">#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }
