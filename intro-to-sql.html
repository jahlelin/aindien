Finding it when we need<br>to then becomes the next most important thing. This is what databases and the<br>SQL language are for. In this book, I will help you get started.<br><br>Database systems manage a lot of data in many different forms. These database<br>systems are called relational databases. They manage the data and access to it.<br>There are many different engines and graphical interfaces for accessing them. At<br>the heart of these systems is the language SQL. While there are minor<br>differences in SQL among the many different projects, they are similar enough to<br>do a quick search to get them working, if you have any prior knowledge of SQL. <br><br>I am going to use the PostgreSQL engine on a Linux installation. I will be using<br>the Fedora distribution and the command line to do everything. PostgreSQL and<br>Linux are not the easiest way to get started, but I feel learning these skills<br>will serve you better in the long-term.<br><br>PostgreSQL started at the University of California at Berkeley. It was a<br>relational database and opensource. <br><br>SQL is a programming language used to query and add information to databases. It<br>tells a database what to do. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Installing PostgreSQL</strong></span><br>These instructions are for a Fedora 40 distribution of Linux.<br>Since there are a lot of different operating systems and ways to install things,<br>keep that in mind if you try to use something different than Fedora. this is<br>what i did to install on my Linux laptop.<br><br>So, open a terminal and type:</p><pre><br><br>dnf install postgresql-server postgresql-contrib<br>systemctl enable postgresql<br>postgresql-setup --initdb --unit postgresql<br>systemctl start postgresql<br>su - postgres<br>psql<br>CREATE USER user_name WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';<br>CREATE DATABASE database_name OWNER user_name;<br>\q<br>psql database_name</pre><p><br><br>That should do it.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Creating Your Database</strong></span><br>Now, let us start working with some data. <br>I am going to make a database to hold various kinds of information. I will start<br>with a library table so I can put some books into it to keep track of. Btw,<br>every database is made up of different tables. These tables should all hold<br>different kinds of information. For example, with our database, I could make a<br>library table, music table, blue-ray table, laptop table, and so on.</p><pre><br><br>create database information;</pre><p><br>We have created a database that can hold information. We can delete it if we<br>want to at some later point by using this command:</p><pre><br><br>drop database information;</pre><p><br><br>If you do that, it is gone. So, becareful if you decide to do it.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Creating Your Table</strong></span><br>Now that we have a database, we need to add tables to hold and organize our<br>information. I am going to start with my books. I will call the table 'library'.</p><pre><br><br>create table library<br>(<br>title varchar(100),<br>author varchar (100),<br>pages integer,<br>publish_date varchar(100),<br>isbn varchar(100)<br>);</pre><p><br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Inserting Data</strong></span><br>We now have a table to add books to. The above lines give the structure of how<br>we want the books added. We will use an insert statement to add individual books<br>to the table.</p><pre><br><br>insert into library values<br>(<br>'Dinosaurs-The Grand Tour',<br>'Keiron Pim',<br>352,<br>'2016',<br>'978-1-61519-274-8'<br>);</pre><p><br><br>Each of the lines with a comma at the end represent a column. This makes it easy<br>to read and understand what you have. When creating tables for other projects,<br>think about what makes sense to have in your table. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Select Statement</strong></span><br>If a few days have passed and you can't remember what book entry you have done,<br>that means you need to query your table to see what it contains. </p><pre><br><br>select * from library;</pre><p><br><br>This will show you the library table and any books it contains. You can see how<br>it is broken up into columns.<br><br>You can also see just parts of the table if you wish.</p><pre><br><br>select title from library;</pre><p><br><br>This just gives you a list of titles in your table. We designed our table to<br>have columns of title, author, page number, date published, and isbn. So, you<br>can select any of those with the select statement.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Where Statement</strong></span><br>The "where" statement gives you the ability to filter information when searching<br>a table. For example, we can search our table by author.</p><pre><br><br>select * from library where author = 'Keiron Pim';</pre><p><br><br>This allows you to search specific records and return the results. <br>We can use operators with the "where" clause and this makes it even more<br>powerful. </p><pre><br><br>select * from library where author &lt;&gt; 'Keiron Pim';</pre><p><br><br>This returns any book not by this author. You can then combine operators such as<br>"and/or" to give very specific data. <br><br>The inserted data is stored in the table, each chunk in a column of its own,<br>making a record. This allows for addressing specific columns by name when<br>selecting the data. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Delete Statement</strong></span><br>We can delete records just as easy as creating them. For example, if we lose a<br>book, we could delete the record of that book if desired. To delete everything<br>in a table, type:</p><pre><br><br>delete from library;</pre><p><br><br>Please do not do this without thinking. Everything will be gone afterwards. <br>The "delete" statement can be used to to get rid of specific records or small<br>groups of them. To delete books by a certain author, we would use:</p><pre><br><br>delete from library where author = 'Pim';</pre><p><br><br>Book records by this author will be gone after this statement. To delete a<br>specific book record, you would want to use a where statement with multiple<br>criteria such as author and page number. That would probabaly get the job done.<br>However, for books, you could just delete the "isbn" record since it should be<br>unique. </p><pre><br><br>delete from library where isbn = '978-1-61519-274-8';</pre><p><br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Alter Statement</strong></span><br>Another way to make records unique is to create a table with the records<br>numbered. This is called a primary key. Then you just use a where statement with<br>the appropriate key and the record is gone. To add another column we do this:</p><pre><br><br>alter table library add column id integer;</pre><p><br><br>Look at your table again with the "select" statement:</p><pre><br>select * from library;</pre><p><br><br>As you can see, we can use the "alter" statement to make our tables look the way<br>we want them. It can be done as many times as we need to. <br>We can delete any columns we want just as easily:</p><pre><br><br>alter table library drop column id;</pre><p><br><br>This will get rid of the column. Use the "select" statement to confirm it is<br>gone as you intended.</p><pre><br><br>select * from library;</pre><p><br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Update Statement</strong></span><br>We can adjust data in any column using the "update" statement. <br>To get the exact record we have to use an id or multiple criteria. Let us look<br>at some examples.<br><br>If you have an "id" column:</p><pre><br>update library set author = 'Moore' where id = 3;</pre><p><br><br>If you want to use multiple criteria:</p><pre><br>update library set pages = 450 where author = 'Pim' and publication-date =<br>'2016';<br><br><br><br><br></pre><h2 id="mcetoc_1i5r5vvr6s" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Modeling Data in SQL</strong></span></h2><p>When dealing with databases, we are working with files and the processes that<br>manage them. There are rules to follow and each database vendor has a slightly<br>different outlook on how you should do things. These different rules affect how<br>you model the data you want to work with. <br><br>Data modeling is the first task you need to tackle. It is the process of putting<br>your ideas into rows, columns, and relations. There are three types of data<br>modeling. They are physical, logical, and conceptual. Each layer refers to a<br>degree of elaboration ending with a model that can be translated into sql<br>statements and implemented into your database system fo chocie. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Conceptual Modeling</strong></span><br>Conceptual modeling deals with the highest level of abstractions such as<br>entities and relationships. Entities refer to the actual physical objects or<br>abstract concepts in your requirements. If you are modeling dats for a library,<br>you might think of books, authors, borrowers, and librarians. If you are<br>creating a data model for a bank, your entities would be accounts, clients,<br>and money. Relationships model the way these entities interact. Relationships<br>are defined through primary and foreign keys.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Logical Modeling</strong></span><br>This is the next step in data modeling. Here you begin by thinking of<br>attributes. The trick is to distinguish between attributes that you want to<br>track as opposed to those that do not matter. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Physical Modeling</strong></span><br>Physical modeling is the final stage. This is where your abstract ideas become<br>something real. You are getting ready to translate your ideas into scripts and<br>implement them in an actual database system. This is the stage where you define<br>the names of your tables, names for columns, and most importantly, your data<br>types. <br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Data Types</strong></span><br>Database systems were created to store information. Data types help to tune<br>database performance. For example, xml data can be represented as text. It is<br>text but text processing is not optimized for the structured nature of xml<br>documents. With the exception of desktop database systems, every single database<br>system vendor decided to implement a specific xml data type to address the<br>issue. <br><br>Another reason for data types' existence is their role in enforcing domain<br>integrity. This refers to the ability of a specific data type to enforce<br>constraints. For example, with a "date" data type, it might be possible to enter<br>a date that also meant something else. Before we can enter the data into our<br>relational database, we have to break the data into pieces of specific data<br>types such as characters, numbers, and pictures. This information is<br>reconstituted by a client application later on.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Character Data</strong></span><br>All character strings in sql can be of fixed length or varying length. A<br>character string can be defined as a sequence of characters that belong to a<br>predefined character set. A character set is the language your database stores.<br>You might remember specifying collation order or locale during your database<br>system setup process. The length of the string is the number of characters in<br>the sequence. This is where internal representation matters. A character can be<br>represented by one or more bytes with latin-based languages. Everyone else in<br>the world, just about, cannot.<br><br>A byte is a computetr term for a unit of information storage that consists of 8<br>bits. Each bit can be either 1 or 0. The combination of 8 bits allows us to<br>store 256 distinct values, which form the foundation of ASCII character sets.<br>While there were attempts to remedy the situation with extended code pages,<br>ultimately the solution came with the introduction of Unicode. It is a standard<br>doub;e byte character set that assigns a unique number to every single<br>character, so it can represent many more characters than ASCII. The Unicode<br>standard is the result of development coordinated by a nonprofit organizaiton<br>called the Unicode consortium. <br><br>Sql thinks in characters but computers count bits and bytes. If you define a<br>string to be of fixed length, the system allocates a certain number of bytes in<br>memory or on a computer hard disk. If your character set is latin based, a total<br>of 10 bytes will be allocated for the string, but if you use a double byte<br>character set, such as chinese, 20 bytes will have to be allocated. It does not<br>matter whether the actual value to be stored in that string is exactly that many<br>bytes or not, it will occupy the whole space that is allocated to it. So, all<br>string will have exactly the same length.<br><br>If you define a string variable as a varying length string with a maximum of 10<br>characters to store, the behavior will be different. The actual memory or disk<br>space required to hold the value will be allocated dynamically as needed. Only<br>strings that are 10 characters long will have all 10 characters allocated to<br>them, but if you have a string that is only 2 characters, only 2 bytes of<br>storage will be allocated. <br><br>As you can imagine, this flexibility comes with a performance hit because the<br>database system must perform the additional task of dynamic allocations. A<br>standard piece of advice when you need to squeeze the last drop of performance<br>out of the database is to profile your data and allocated fixed length strings<br>for values that always come in predefined lengths. Just don't forget to have<br>checks in place for your inserts. An attempt to insert 11 characters into a<br>field defined as char(10) would result in an error. Also, when comparing two<br>character strings, variable length strings would not care much about trailing<br>blanks but fixed length strings would.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Binary Strings</strong></span><br>A binary string is a sequence of bytes in the same way that a character string<br>is a sequence of characters, but unlike character strings that usually contain<br>information in the form of text, a binary string is used to hold nontraditional<br>data such as images, audio, and video files. Binary strings can be used for<br>purposes similar to those of character strings, but the two data types are not<br>compatible. The difference is like text and a photo of the same text. <br><br>It might be a little confusing to learn that plain text documents can be stored<br>as character strings and a Word document has to be treated as a binary string. A<br>Word or Pdf file is a text document from a user's point of view, but from a<br>computer storage perspective, it is not. In addition to plain text characters,<br>it contains many special markers and instructions that only those programs can<br>interpret. The same is true for any other special files such as bitmaps.<br>spreadsheets, audio files, and video files. <br><br>Because a Pdf is a binary file, it also contains information about fonts,<br>positioning, coloring, and other formatting. This information is a set of<br>instructions that the host program understands and can interpret to display<br>human readable text and any other objects that might be embedded into the<br>document.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Numeric Data</strong></span><br>After the characters come numbers. Exact numbers can either be whole integers or<br>have decimal points. Numbers can be positive and negative. They can have<br>precision and scale. Precision determines the maximum total number of decimal<br>digits that can be stored. Scale specifies the maximum number of decimals<br>allowed. <br><br>Approximate numbers are numbers that cannot be represented with absolute<br>precision. Each numeric data type has limits, a range of values that it can<br>represent which is pretty consistent across systems. The value ranges for some<br>common numeric data types. <br><br>Most of the time, numbers are hidden in the database. Once in a while, you might<br>need to use numbers as a value inserted into your query, and databases can be<br>very particular in what format you supply them. Literals for numbers are<br>represented as strings, optionally preceded by plus or minus signs, with an<br>optional decimal part for numeric or decimal data types separated by a dot.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Time Data Types</strong></span><br>Handling dates and time is probably one of the most confusing and inconsistent<br>topics in sql. Partly them comes from the inconsistency of the human devised<br>system of tracking days and times. The date data type behaves differently from<br>implementation to implementation. Some system have separate keywords and others<br>comebine date and times into one keyword for queries. <br><br>The dates and times get into the database as literals as a return result from a<br>function or as a conversion. The database systems have implemented a number of<br>sql functions to help handle this peculiar data type. While it might be apparent<br>to humans that some literal strings are veritable dates, computers have no such<br>insight and try to treat anything as a date. Once dates are in the database, you<br>need to take extra care manipulating them. For example, if you compare two dates<br>that have the same day, month, and year component but differ in time they will<br>be evaluated as not equal. Be sure to compare apples to apples. There are many<br>date and time related functions to help you compare values, extract information,<br>and even do date arithmetic.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Binaery Data</strong></span><br>Binary data are for computers to understand and interpret so that humans can<br>understand. Prime examples of binary data are pictures and only your image<br>editor knows how to arrange these ones and zeros into a picture. There is not<br>much you can do with binary data in sql besides storing it and retrieving it on<br>demand.
