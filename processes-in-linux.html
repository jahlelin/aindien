It runs a series of shell scripts<br>(located in /etc) called init scripts, which start all the system services. Many<br>of these services are implemented as daemon programs, programs that just sit in<br>the background and do their thing without having any user interface. So, even if<br>we are not logged in, the system is at least a little busy performing routine<br>stuff.<br><br>The fact that a program can launch other programs is expressed in the process<br>scheme as a parent process producing a child process. The kernel maintains<br>information about each process to help keep things organized. For example, each<br>process is assigned a number called a process ID. PID's are assigned in<br>descending order, with init always getting PID 1. The kernel also keeps track of<br>the memory assigned to each process, as well as the processes' readiness to<br>resume execution. Like files, processes also have owners and user IDs, effective<br>user IDs, and so on.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Viewing Processes</strong></span><br>The most commonly used command to view processes is 'ps'. The 'ps' program has a<br>lot of options but it is used like this:<br><br><code>ps</code><br><br>The result in this example lists two processes, which are bash and ps. As we can<br>see, ps does not show us very much, just the processes associated with the<br>current terminal session. To see more, we need to add some options. <br><br>If we add an option, we can get a bigger picture of what the system is doing.<br><br><code>ps x</code><br><br>Adding the x option tells ps to show all of our processes regardless of what<br>terminal they are controlled by. The presence of a ? in the TTY column indicates<br>no controlling terminal. Using this option, we see a list of every process that<br>we own.<br><br>Because the system is running a lot of processes, ps produces a long list. It is<br>often helpful to pipe the output from ps to less for easier viewing. Some option<br>combinations also produce long lines of output, so maximizing the terminal<br>emulator window might be a good idea too.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Processor States</strong></span><br>R       Running<br>S       Sleeping<br>D       Uninterruptible sleep<br>T       Stopped<br>Z       Defunct or zombie process<br>&lt;       High priority process<br>N       Low priority process<br><br>The process state may be followed by other characters. These indicate various<br>exotic process characteristics. Another popular set of options is aux. This<br>gives us even more information. <br><br><code>ps aux</code><br><br>This set of options displays the processes belonging to every user. Using the<br>options without the leading dash invokes the command with BSD style behavior.<br>The linux version of ps can emulate the behavior of the ps program found in<br>different unix implementations.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Viewing Processes Dynamically</strong></span><br>While the ps command can reveal a lot about what the machine is doing, it<br>provides only a snapshot of the machine's state at the moment the ps command is<br>executed. To see a more dynamic view of the machine's activity, we use the top<br>command.<br><br><code>top</code><br><br>The top program displays a continuously updating display of the system processes<br>listed in order of process activity. The name top comes from the fact that the<br>top program is used to see the top processes of the system. The top display<br>consists of two parts, a system summary at the top of the display, followed by a<br>table of processes sorted by cpu activity. <br><br>The top program accepts a number of keyboard commands. The two most interesting are h, which displays the program's help screen, and q, which quits top. <br><br>Both major desktop environments provide graphical applications that display<br>information similar to top, but top is better than the graphical versions<br>because it is faster and it consumes far fewer system resources. After all, our<br>system monitor program should not be the source of the system slowdown that we<br>are trying to track.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Controlling Processes</strong></span><br>Now that we can see and monitor processes, let us gain some control over them.<br>Type gedit to open that program. Now type control-c to interrupt the program. It<br>should close. Most command line programs can be closed in this way. <br><br>If we want the shell program back on top but still want another program to run,<br>we can put it into the background. To launch a program so that it is immediately<br>placed in the background, we follow the command with a &amp; character.<br><br><code>gedit &amp;</code><br><br>After entering the command, the window appeared and the shell prompt returned. A message will appear which is a shell feature called job control. With this<br>message, the shell is telling us we have started a job number and what its PID<br>is. If we then run ps, we can see this process.<br><br>The shell's job control facility also gives us a way to list the jobs that have<br>been launched from our terminal. Using the jobs command, we can see this list.<br><br><code>jobs</code><br><br>This shows us a list of the current jobs running.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Returning a Process to the Foreground</strong></span><br>A process in the background is immune from terminal keyboard input, including<br>any attempt to interrupt it with control-c. To return a process to the<br>foreground, use the fg command:<br><br><code>// run jobs command to get the job number of process you want</code><br><code>jobs</code><br><code>// then use the job number with the fg command</code><br><code>fg %1    // 1 is the job number we want to bring to foreground</code><br><br>The fg command followed by a percent sign and then job number is how you use it. If we have only one background, the job number is optional.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Stopping A Process</strong></span><br>Sometimes we will want to stop a process without terminating it. This is the<br>same as pausing it. This is often done to allow a foreground process to be moved<br>to the background. To stop a foreground process and place it in the background,<br>press control-z.<br><br>After stopping the process, we can verify that the program has stopped by trying<br>to use it. It will not work. We can either continue the program's execution in<br>the background, using the fg command, or resume the program's execution in the<br>background with the bg command. <br><br><code>bg %1</code><br><br>As with the fg command, the job number is optional if there is only one job.<br>Moving a process from the foreground to the background is handy if we launch a<br>graphical program from the command line but forget to place it in the background<br>by appending the trailing &amp;.<br><br>There are two reasons why we would want to launch a graphical program from the<br>command line. The program you want to run might not be listed on the window<br>manager's menu. By launching a program from the command line, you might be able<br>to see error messages that would otherwise be invisible if the program were<br>launched graphically. <br><br>Sometimes, a program will fail to start up when launched from the graphical<br>menu. By launching it from the command line instead, we may see an error message<br>that will reveal the problem. Also, some graphical programs have interesting and<br>useful command line options.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Signals</strong></span><br>The kill command is used to kill processes. This allows us to terminate programs<br>that need killing.<br><br><code>kill 16606</code><br><br>We get the process ID from one of the ways mentioned before, then use that ID<br>with the kill command. We could have also used a job number if we wanted to go<br>that route. <br><br>While this is straightforward, there is more to it than that. The kill command<br>does not exactly kill processes, it sends them signals. Signals are one of<br>several ways that the operating system communicates with programs. We have<br>already seen signals in action with the use of control-c and control-z.<br><br>When the terminal receives one of these keystrokes, it sends a signal to the<br>program in the foreground. In the case of control-c, a signal called INT<br>(interrupt) is sent. Programs, in turn, listen for signals and may act upon them<br>as they are received. The fact that a program can listen and act upon signals<br>allows a program to do things such as save work in progress when it is sent a<br>terminating signal.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Sending Signals to Processes</strong></span><br>The kill command is used to send signals to programs. Its most common syntax is<br>this:<br><br><code>kill -signal (PID)</code><br><br>If no signal is specified on the command line, then the terminate signal is sent<br>by default. <br><br>1        hup        hang up<br>2        int        interrupt<br>9        kill    kill<br>15        term    terminate<br>18        cont    continue<br>19        stop    stop<br>20        tstp    terminal stop<br><br><code>kill -1 16606</code><br><br>In this example,  sent the process a hup singal with the kill command. It<br>terminates and the shell indicates that the background process has received a<br>hang up signal. We may need to press enter a couple of times before the message<br>appears. Note that the signal may be specified either by number or by name.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Sending Signals to Multiple Processes</strong></span><br>It is also possible to send signals to multiple processes matching a specified<br>program or username by using the killall command.<br><br><code>killall -u user -signal name</code><br><br>To demonstrate, we will start a couple of instances of programs and terminate<br>them.<br><br><code>killall gedit</code><br><br>As with the kill command, you must have superuser privileges to send kill<br>signals to processes that do not belong to you.<br><br><span style="color: #169179;"><strong>Shutting Down the System</strong></span><br>The process of shutting down the system involves the orderly termination of all<br>the processes on the system, as well as performing some vital housekeeping<br>chores before the system powers off. Four different commands can perform this<br>function.<br><br>halt<br>poweroff<br>reboot<br>shutdown<br><br>The first three are self explanatory and are generally used without any command<br>line options. The shutdown command is more interesting. With it, we can specify<br>which of the actions to perform and provide a time delay to the shutdown event.<br>Most often it is used like this to halt the system:<br><br><code>shutdown -h now</code><br><br>We can also use it like this:<br><br><code>shutdown -r now</code><br><br>The delay can be specified in a variety of ways. Once the shutdown command is<br>executed, a message is broadcast to all logged in users warning them of the<br>impending event. Because monitoring processes is an important system<br>administration task, there are a lot of commands for it.<br><br>pstree        outputs a process list arranged in a tree like pattern<br>vmstat        outputs a snapshot of system resource usage<br>xload        graphical program that draws a graph showing system load over time<br>tload        same as xload but draws the graph in the terminal<br><br>Most modern systems feature a mechanism for managing multiple processes. Linux provides a rich set of tools for this purpose. Unlike other systems, Linux<br>relies primarily on command line tools for process management. Though there are<br>graphical process tools for Linux, the command line tools are greatly preferred<br>because of their speed and light footprint.<br><br><br></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 3, 2024</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://aindien.com/linux/">Linux</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fprocesses-in-linux.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fprocesses-in-linux.html&amp;via=_Aindien&amp;text=Processes%20in%20Linux" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://aindien.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://aindien.com/accessing-files-in-python.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Accessing Files in Python</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://aindien.com/encapsulating-data-in-python.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Encapsulating Data in Python </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-08-07T08:43" class="feed__date">August 7, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/managing-input-and-output-streams-in-the-linux-shell.html" class="invert"> Managing Input and Output Streams in the Linux Shell</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-07-15T23:08" class="feed__date">July 15, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/managing-files-in-a-linux-environment.html" class="invert">Managing Files In A Linux Environment</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-04-27T22:35" class="feed__date">April 27, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/the-linux-shell-for-beginners.html" class="invert">The Linux Shell For Beginners</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><style type="text/css">#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }
