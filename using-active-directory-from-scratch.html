To access anything, they<br>have to be authenticated. Authentication is proving who you are and can happen<br>in many ways. The most common is by logging on to your computer at the beginning<br>of the day. However, your company could use smart cards or fingerprint devices.<br>Often, large companies will use more than one option.<br><br>When you log on in the mornings, you are logging in to the domain and not just<br>the local computer. It uses the Kerberos protocol when authenticating a user.<br>The local computer must have an accurate time or you will not be able to<br>authenticate. <br><br>Once a user has been authenticated onto the system, they must have authorization<br>to access any particular resources. Resources are things like file shares and<br>email. This is done by a token that is created on your computer. The token<br>contains various data and talks to the resource you are trying to access. It<br>decides if you will be able to do so. Tokens are created locally and are not<br>supposed to travel across the network. <br><br>You decide if you need Active Directory or not by considering if you want to do<br>this manually for all your users. I am sure a few is no problem but if you have<br>10,000 users that would just be impossible. <br><br>You will encounter a lot of terminology. One of the first is called a forest.<br>This is your Active Directory. It can contain one or more domains. The first<br>domain is called the root domain. All the domains you create share a common<br>configuration that you set up. <br><br>A domain is a container. It includes users, machines, groups, and other things.<br>Administrators of one domain will not have access to other domains. It is the<br>same with permissions. Objects inside one domain cannot affect objects outside<br>the domain. Policies work the same way. They should only be applied to their one<br>domain. <br><br>An organizational unit is another type of container. It exists within domains.<br>It holds user, computer, and other object data. These units exist to give split<br>up the duties of administrators and dictate how group policies get applied.<br><br>Creating users and managing their accounts accounts for a lot of the work of an administrator. Their is work to do anytime a user leaves, joins, changes groups,<br>or needs a password reset. Many times users are put into groups because they<br>have similar needs. An example of this can be the users from a certain<br>department because they all need similar permissions to resources. User accounts<br>change the most because of this. <br><br>When creating new accounts, it is often best to base them off a template. Then,<br>you are just duplicating something that works instead of not remembering<br>everything. User accounts are created with the Active Directory graphical tools<br>or with Powershell. Run Powershell commands an as administrator. <br><br>You will need to first download the Active Directory module into Powershell.<br><br><code>import-module ActiveDirectory</code><br><br>It will probably be easier to use the graphical tools for most people. Just open<br>one of the graphical tools and click new user from the menu. Give the<br>information that is asked of you. In fact, the best practice for this sort of<br>thing is to use a template that you know works correctly. Then just duplicate<br>that for each new user. It is something like this:</p><p> </p><ul><li>open ADUC</li><li>choose account to use as template</li><li>right click and choose copy</li><li>give the correct name for new user</li><li>enter logon name then click next</li><li>enter password and click next</li><li>click finish<br><br><br></li></ul><p>When you have to create many new users at once, it is much better to use<br>Powershell for this. You know it works and it is much faster. Here is an<br>example:<br><br><code>$newpass = read-host "password" -assecurestring</code><br><code>new-aduser -name "moore jason" -samaccountname jmoore `</code><br><code>-userprincipalname "jmoore@aindien.com" -accountpassword $newpass `</code><br><code>-path "cn=users,dc=aindien,dc=com" -enabled:$true</code><br><br>Modify this as needed. There are a lot more options you can use to script new<br>user creation. Powershell documentation for the Active Directory module will<br>show you these details.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ioocjsbv1i" class="align-center"><br><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Updating Accounts</strong></span></h2><p>Part of account management includes updating and deleting accounts. We update<br>accounts because phone numbers and addresses can change. We can also disable or<br>enable accounts as needed. <br><br>Delete accounts when those users have left the company. Otherwise, it is a<br>security risk. Active Directory has to be updated so it can be efficient. <br><br>To modify a user account, use one of the graphical tools:</p><ul><li>search for the account you want to modify</li><li>right click that account and choose properties</li><li>choose the field you need to modify</li></ul><p><br>When changing a field, clear it first and then type in the correct value. We can<br>also do it using Powershell.<br><br><code>set-aduser -identity "cn=Moore Jason, cn=users, dc=aindien, dc =com"</code><br><code>-officephone "345 6789"</code><br><br>If a user is going to be gone for a while, but still with the company, then<br>disabling the account should be considered. If they will not be accessing it<br>then it would be a security vulnerability. It can just be re-enabled when the<br>user gets back. It is easy to disable an account:</p><ul><li>search for the account</li><li>right click it</li><li>choose disable</li></ul><p>Using Powershell its easy too.<br><br><code>disable-adaccount -identity jmoore</code><br><br>You do the exact same process to enable accounts. Right click the account and<br>choose enable. <br><br><code>enable-adaccount -identity jmoore</code><br><br>If a user leaves the company then it is time to delete the account. To do so:</p><ul><li>search for the account in question</li><li>remove protection against deletion, if enabled</li><li>right click and choose delete</li><li>confirm that is what you want to do in pop-up box</li></ul><p> </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iooojbup2a" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Groups</strong></span></h2><p>Groups are another way to organize your users and data. You definitely want to<br>use them too. You put the users from some department into the same group. You<br>give the group certain permissions. All the users in that group now have the<br>same permissions. Groups makes you more efficient.<br><br>Groups are just containers. They can hold users, computers, and other groups<br>too. There are several kinds of groups. Each has advantages. The main action you<br>take to groups is adding and removing users. <br><br>There are two types of groups, security and distribution. Security groups helps<br>you handle permissions for your users. Distribution groups are used in Exchange<br>to send messages to other groups. A group can contain user accounts, computer<br>accounts, and other groups. User accounts or computers belong to a global group,<br>global groups belong to domain local groups, and those belong to access control<br>lists. The access control lists control access to your resources. These<br>resources can be shares, folders, files, and printers.<br><br>Creating groups is a straightforward process. You can do it with either the<br>graphical tools or with Powershell. You have to know what container to create it<br>in, a group name, and the group samaccountname. </p><ul><li>open the graphical tool you prefer</li><li>go to the container you want to create it in</li><li>right click the container</li><li>choose new group</li><li>click ok to finish</li></ul><p><br>Your new group is created. It can be modified as well in the future. We can<br>create a group using Powershell as well:<br><br><code>new-adgroup -name testgroup -path "cn=users, dc=aindien, dc=com"</code><br><code>-groupcategory security -groupscope global</code><br><code>-description "test group"</code><br><br>Deleting a group can be done when necessary. Make sure it is no longer needed<br>before you do. In your graphical tools just right click the group and click<br>delete. In Powershell we can do:<br><br><code>remove-adgroup -identity testgroup -confirm:$false</code><br><br>Managing groups boils down to viewing members, adding new members, and removing<br>members from the group. In the graphical tools, right click and select<br>properties. Once you have your list of members, select a user and click the<br>remove button. To add a user to a group using Powershell use:<br><br><code>add-adgroupmember -identity testgroup -members "cn=moore jason, cn=users,</code><br><code>dc=aindien, dc=com"</code><br><br>Removing a group member using Powershell is:<br><br><code>remove-adgroupmember -identity testgroup -members jmoore -confirm:$false</code><br><br></p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ioqe6fon5m" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Troubleshooting Issues</strong></span></h2><p>Sometimes problems occur. It is just a fact of life. It is usually when someone<br>can't log on or access some resource they need to. The most common issues are<br>expired password, forgotten their password, locked their account from too many<br>password guesses, or they are not in the correct group in order to access those<br>resources. Most problems are password related, as you can see. <br><br>When you have an issue with a user check to see if the account is disabled, see<br>if it is expired, then see if they are locked out. So, the first thing we need<br>to do is pull up his account and take a look at those afore-mentioned issues<br>first. <br><br>If it is not one of the previous issues then the problem is probably password<br>related. Active Directory passwords expire every few weeks by default so you<br>need to be on top of this. Passwords will cause a lot of issues. You can see<br>what accounts have expired with a little Powershell:<br><br><code>search-adaccount -passwordexpired</code><br><br>If the account in question comes up in the list, you just reset the password.<br>You should have them reset their own password. You just have the system do this.<br>You do this by having the user much change password at next log on option. <br><br>Locked accounts are another issue. They happen because users forget their<br>password and try too many times incorrectly in a time period. You will be able<br>to see when a particular account is locked when you open the account up in the<br>graphical tools. You can do the same thing with Powershell.<br><br><code>search-acaccount -lockedout</code><br><br>You can unlock just as easily.<br><br><code>search-adaccount -lockedout | unlock-adaccount</code><br><br>Group membership is the last main cause of problems. When a user cannot access<br>the resource they need. this is often the issue. You will have to find what<br>group this resource is part of so you can add the user to this group. This can<br>happen when a user is new or if they change positions. </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ioqe6fon5n" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Machine Accounts</strong></span></h2><p>Most of the data in Active Directory is users, groups, and machine accounts. The<br>machine accounts have to be managed too. We do this by taking advantage of group<br>policy. Don't worry, it wont mind. Your workstations and servers should be in<br>here so everything will be much easier to manage. <br><br>The workstation will join the domain just like a user does. This is often when<br>the workstation account gets created too. This machine authenticates to the<br>domain controller as well. Someday, when this machine gets replaced, this<br>account will get deleted like everything in Active Directory. <br><br>You can create machine accounts in the graphical tools and Powershell. You<br>should do so in your machine container or OU. You can put them elsewhere if and<br>when you need to after you are very familiar with the process. It is a good idea<br>to just keep them here and separate from your user accounts. </p><ul><li>open ADAC</li><li>choose machine container</li><li>choose task menu then new</li><li>choose computer</li><li>type computer name</li><li>check protect from accidental deletion</li><li>add the computer to any groups it needs</li><li>choose ok to create the account</li></ul><p>Powershell can do this just as easily.<br><br><code>new-adcomputer -enabled $true -name finance3 -path "cn=computers, dc=aindien,</code><br><code>dc=com -samaccountname FINANCE3</code><br><br>Joining a computer to the domain is usually the next step. This should be<br>limited to some type of administrator. The machine needs to have DNS set up and<br>local administrator permissions. You will need an account name and password that<br>can join the domain. Lastly, you should rename it to its final form and restart. </p><ul><li>open control panel and choose system</li><li>select advanced system settings</li><li>select computer name</li><li>choose domain and provide a domain name</li><li>select ok</li></ul><p><br>Give your admin credentials. Select okay and then restart. <br><br>Issues can occur between a machine and the domain controller. Most often you<br>will see a message stating there are no log on servers available. There are<br>other messages but they mean mostly the same thing. The cause is usually because<br>a machine has not been turned on to authenticate with the domain controller in a<br>long time. This time can vary but something like 30 days is usually the culprit.<br>The easiest solution is to rejoin the machine to the domain and restart. You can<br>also reset it in the graphical tools but I prefer the first way.<br><br>Deleting a machine account is the last thing you will do with it. You will<br>usually do this when the machine has been replaced through a hardware upgrade.<br>Then the machine account process is restarted. Delete them through the graphical<br>tools or Powershell. Be careful not to delete a domain controller if it shows<br>up.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iotu5ee87j" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Organizational Units</strong></span></h2><p>Organizational units help separate all your different objects into something<br>manageable. It makes it easier to delegate permissions and set group policy. An<br>OU is just a container. There won't be much to do with it after its created and<br>you have objects in it. You will move objects from one OU to another. <br><br>An OU is a container inside a domain. It can hold machines, users, and groups.<br>It is created when you want a certain few admins to be responsible for this OU<br>or to help with group policy. OU's are mainly used to divide departments,<br>locations, users and machines, and possibly servers if you have a lot. You can<br>create OU's within other OU's but you shouldn't do this too much. Just do it if<br>needed because it can impact performance if done too much. <br><br>Organizational units can be created with graphical tools or Powershell. Try to<br>make your names consistent. Everything does not have to be perfect but the more<br>you try the fewer problems and conflicts you will have later. <br><br>To create an OU with ADAC:</p><ul><li>choose OU or the domain to create it in</li><li>choose new, then organizational unit from the menu</li><li>give it a name</li><li>give any information that is helpful to you</li><li>click ok</li></ul><p><br>You can also create OU's with Powershell. There are several commands for working<br>with OU's.</p><ul><li>new-adorganizationalunit</li><li>get-adorganizational unit</li><li>set-adorganizational unit</li><li>remove-adorganizational unit</li></ul><p><br>Here is a short example:<br><br><code>new-adorganizational unit -name Hillsboro -path "dc=aindien, dc=com"</code><br><code>-protectfromaccidentaldeletion:$true -passthru</code><br><br>There is not a lot to do to manage an OU. Typically, it involves renaming,<br>setting the description, changing the manager, and deleting it when necessary.<br>To rename an OU, select, right click and choose properties, then you should see<br>an option to rename.<br><br>Giving an OU a description can be useful. To do so, right lick it, choose<br>properties, and enter the description. <br><br>Changing who manages an OU is really just a reminder. You still have to give<br>that user the permissions to do his job. <br><br>Eventually you might have to delete an OU. To do so, right click the OU, choose<br>delete, remove the protection, then do it again, lastly select yes to delete the<br>OU. <br><br>Moving objects between OU's will happen occasionally. You do this when some<br>objects are created in default containers but they should belong elsewhere, a<br>user has changed roles and needs different permissions.  </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iotu5ee87k" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Creating Group Policies</strong></span></h2><p>Group policy is how we manage security and configuration of all your machines.<br>Group policy can be applied to the domain or a certain organizational unit. A<br>group policy object defines a bunch of settings. You can fine tune a lot of<br>these settings in Windows. These settings can be applied to users by<br>organizational unit or domain. A group policy object can contain thousands of<br>settings. It depends on how much you want to fine tune things in your<br>environment. <br><br>You should keep user and machine settings separate. Do as little as possible with<br>group policy objects to fix the issue you need fixed. Use templates when<br>possible as these are pre-configured. <br><br>You create group policy objects in the group policy management console. Create<br>your objects in the group policy object container. You cannot add a description<br>to the object when using the management console. We can use Powershell to create<br>an object too.<br><br>First, import the group policy module.<br><code>import-module grouppolicy</code><br><br>As with other modules, checkout all the commands that come with this module.<br><code>get-command -module grouppolicy</code><br><br>To create a group policy object, we use:<br><code>new-gpo -name labpcs -comment "settings for all lab pc's"</code><br><br>There are a bunch of other settings you can add like display name, domain name,<br>ID, description, and many others. You will see those options in the help for the<br>commands. <br><br>After you have created a group policy object, you will need top modify it to put<br>in your settings and who it will affect. It is a good idea to configure a group<br>policy object with either user or machine settings. A computer configuration<br>applies to a machine no matter what user is on it. A user configuration applies<br>to the user no matter what computer they are on. You can use the group policy<br>management console to designate whether you will use user or machine settings. <br><br>When configuring your settings in the management console, try to use as few as<br>possible to get the job done. You do not want to duplicate a lot of settings<br>across the containers you have or other group policy objects. When a group<br>policy object is created you will have a lot of settings to look at and<br>configure. Go through them and double click them to change or set up for the<br>first time. </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iovh87oe96" class="align-center"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Managing Group Policies</strong></span></h2><p>This chapter will be about linking group policy objects you have created to your<br>domains and organizational units. Group policy objects will need to be removed<br>once they are no long needed. <br><br>Applying a group policy object is known as linking. Linking can be done in an AD<br>site, a domain, and in an organizational unit. I wouldn't link a group policy<br>object to a site. The reason why is that anything you do later in a domain or<br>organizational unit can override the site settings. That makes your effort spent<br>inefficient. You can apply a group policy object as it is created and set an<br>existing one to a domain or organizational unit. It is very easy to have<br>conflicting policies so be careful and apply them as little as possible. <br><br>You use the group policy management console to set group policy objects. </p><ul><li>open the management console</li><li>go to where the group policy object is to be linked</li><li>right click and choose link existing gpo</li><li>select it and hit ok</li></ul><p><br>The management console will show you what linked policies you have. They will be<br>in the right window pane. You can create a link using Powershell also:<br><br><code>get-gpo -name lab_machines | new-gplink -target "ou=lab_machines, dc=aindien,</code><br><code>dc=com"</code><br><br>One part of managing an environment is knowing how group policy objects affect<br>your users and machines. The main way of doing this is looking through the<br>management console. It shows you organization units and what group policy<br>objects are linked to it. You can see the reverse view as well, what links a<br>group policy object has. <br><br>Links can be removed too. You can delete the group policy object which will<br>remove all of the links or you can unlink the objects from the organizational<br>unit it is applied too. </p><ul><li>open the management console</li><li>choose the group policy objects container</li><li>right click the group policy object and select delete</li><li>Confirm your action in the pop up box and choose yes</li></ul><p><br>We can delete a group policy object using Powershell:<br><br><code>remove-gpo -name lab_machines</code><br><br>If you just want to unlink the group policy from a container then open up the<br>management console:</p><ul><li>open management console</li><li>go to where the group policy is linked, like an OU or domain</li><li>right click the group policy and choose delete</li><li>confirm your action and choose ok</li></ul><p><br>We can unlink a group policy using Powershell as well:<br><br><code>remove-gplink -name lab_machines -target "ou=lab_machines, dc=aindien, dc=com"</code><br><br>Group policy objects are applied in a certain order when a user logs on or when<br>the machine is turned on.

They are called password settings objects, or pso's. Password<br>settings allow you to have multiple objects for the same domain.<br><br>You can have settings for admins and users. You can have several if you want and<br>they are tied to the groups you have created. This gives you a lot of<br>flexibility. You can manage password settings through a graphical tool and<br>Powershell. <br><br>Password settings can be set to groups or users. However, it is best to just use<br>groups for your settings. This will be a lot easier in the long run. <br><br>You can create password settings in ADAC or Powershell. ADAC is probably the<br>easiest to begin with but Powershell lets you automate things if you want to<br>script something for your environment. To create password settings:</p><ul><li>open ADAC</li><li>choose system folder</li><li>select password settings and then choose new</li><li>select password setting</li><li>complete all the questions in the box</li><li>choose ok</li></ul><p><br>There will be some mandatory fields and default values. Choose what makes sense<br>for your environment. <br><br>If this is not the first policy you have created, you may want to see what<br>settings are already there. Open ADAC, choose system folder, then choose<br>password settings. The current password objects will appear. You can click any<br>password policy listed there and modify if you need to. <br><br>You can see the same thing using Powershell:<br><br><code>get-adfinegrainedpasswordpolicy -filter *</code><br><br>It will show you everything it has. <br>You can see any particular policy using its name:<br><br><code>get-adfinegrainedpasswordpolicy -identity admins</code><br><br>When applying password settings, set them at the group level. In ADAC, after you<br>have created the policy, just apply them at the same time. You do this by using<br>the Directly Applies To box. Just choose the group. You can remove a policy by<br>doing the same thing, just open the drop down box and choose. </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 16, 2025</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://aindien.com/active-directory/">active directory</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fusing-active-directory-from-scratch.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fusing-active-directory-from-scratch.html&amp;via=_Aindien&amp;text=Learning%20Active%20Directory%20From%20Scratch" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://aindien.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://aindien.com/intro-to-sql.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> SQL Explained</a></div></div></nav><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><style type="text/css">#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }
