These are very useful if you want to begin structuring your Word document or, for example, if you want to ensure that a new chapter starts at the top of a new page. I have my document open in Word. I have some chapters in it which are visible in the navigation pane on the left side of the window.</div><div> </div><div>I want to insert some page breaks so that the document is better organized and the reader can follow the sections easier. To insert a page break, I'll first select a location to insert it by simply clicking to move my insertion point. I'll click on chapter 2 in the navigation pane, and then I will scroll up a bit. Notice that chapter 1 ends on the same page that chapter 2 begins. I want the second chapter to begin on the next page, so I will click above the heading for chapter 2, and then to find the page break options, I click on the Layout tab, and in the Page Setup toolset, I click on Breaks.</div><div> </div><div>This opens up a menu, and in the Page Breaks section, we have the options to break Page, Column or Text Wrapping. I'll click on Page, and then I'll scroll up a bit, and now the first chapter ends on this page, and I'll scroll down, and the second chapter begins on the next page. If you want to save some time when inserting a page break, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Enter.</div><div> </div><div>So I'll scroll down a bit more, and notice that chapter 3 is on the same page as chapter 2, so I will click above chapter 3 and then I'll use my keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Enter, and now chapter 3 begins on the next page. When inserting breaks into your document, it can be handy to activate paragraph marks. This will display where the page breaks are located in your document. To do this, I'll click on the Home tab, and then in the Paragraph toolset,</div><div> </div><div>I click on the Show/Hide paragraph marks icon. Now the breaks are visible in the document. Let's scroll up a bit, and the page break that I just inserted after chapter 2 is now visible due to the paragraph marks. It is important to note that when working with page breaks, you can add text before a page break. Let's click at the end of chapter 2, and then I'll start a new line by pressing Enter on my keyboard, then you can type some text into your document. And notice that the next page does not change.</div><div> </div><div>You can also do this with images by adding a text wrapping break. It is useful to add a text wrapping break so you can specify where you want the text to break around your image. So in the navigation pane, I will click on the fourth chapter. And then under the "Energy saving" section, I will click on the image and open up the Layout Options. In the Layout Options menu, the With Text Wrapping option is already applied. Then I'll click away to close this menu, and I will click to remove the insertion point to where I want the text to break. Now I click on the Layout tab, and in the Page Setup toolset, I open the Breaks menu. And under Page Breaks, I click Text Wrapping. Now I can scroll back down a little, and the text wrapping mark is indicated by this arrow. I can click at the end of the sentence here and add some text, and the text and the image has not been affected due to the text wrapping break.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Creating a formatting section</strong></h2><div>The Word section tool can be used to create distinct zones within your document. These zones, known as sections, can be organized and formatted individually, allowing you to have complete control over your documents appearance. You can, for example, arrange your sections' text into columns, or even change the page orientation to landscape.</div><div> </div><div>I have a document open, and I will first display the formatting marks. To do this, I click on the File tab, and then I click on More [Video description begins] The File backstage view opens with the navigation menu on the left, and the content of the selected option displayed on the right. [Video description ends] from the navigation pane, which opens up a menu where I click on Options. This opens up the Word Options window, [Video description begins] The Word Options window opens with a navigation bar on the left. The content of the selected option is displayed in the main panel. [Video description ends] and from the window I click on Display from the navigation pane. In the section Always show these formatting marks on the screen, I check Show all formatting marks. Then I click OK to apply the changes, and close the window.</div><div> </div><div>Some of the existing formatting marks are the paragraphs, and I can scroll down a bit, and there is a text wrapping break. To insert a section break, first click where you want to insert it into the document - I'll click between these two sections here, and then I click on the Layout tab, and in the Page Setup toolset, I click on Breaks.</div><div> </div><div>This opens up a menu, and I can scroll down to view the Section Breaks section where we have options for Next Page, Continuous, Even Page and Odd Page. I'll insert a Next Page section break, so I'll click on the first option. Thanks to the formatting marks being activated, I know that the section break has been successfully inserted in the correct area and that the text following the section break has been moved to the next page.</div><div> </div><div>If you want to delete a section break, click before the section break and then press the Delete key on your keyboard, not the Backspace key. And the section break has now been deleted. You can format only part of a page by using invisible or continuous breaks. To create a section within a page, choose the insertion point - I will scroll up a bit and click before the first paragraph, then I open up the Breaks menu again, and then in the Section Breaks section, I click on Continuous.</div><div> </div><div>Since I want to format only part of the page, I will add a section break after this paragraph as well by clicking after the last sentence and reopening the Breaks menu and clicking on Continuous again. Now that there are two section breaks around the two paragraphs, at the top and the bottom, we can format this section.</div><div> </div><div>So let's select the section by clicking and dragging with our mouse, and we can format these two paragraphs into columns. So I open the Columns menu and then I click on Two. Notice, when setting a text selection into columns, section breaks are automatically added. Now that these paragraphs are in sections, we can also adjust the page setup options.</div><div> </div><div>I'll first place the cursor in the section by clicking before the first word, and then to access the Page Setup window, in the Page Setup toolset I click to open up the dialog box launcher for the Page Setup window. Then, in the Margins tab, and in the Margins section, I can set the top margin - I'll click on the up arrow button to set it to 3 cm.</div><div> </div><div>We can set the bottom margin - I'll set this to 3 cm as well. We can set the left margin - we'll set this to 3.5 cm by clicking on the up arrow button. And we can set the right margin - we'll set this one to 3.5 cm as well by clicking on the up arrow button. In the Orientation section, the page is currently set to Portrait orientation. To change it to Landscape orientation, we simply click on this option. Notice that the preview is available at the bottom of the window.</div><div> </div><div>In the Apply to section, make sure 'This section' is selected. And then I can click on the Paper tab, where we have the options to change the paper size and the paper source. And in the Layout tab, we have the options to choose the section start, the headers and footers, and in the Page section, we can change the vertical alignment by opening the dropdown menu, and we can change it to Top, Center, Justified or Bottom.</div><div> </div><div>I'll change the alignment to Center. Then, I click on OK to apply the changes and close the window. And now I can scroll down, and only this section of the document has been modified. Notice that the continuous section break became the next page. This is because you can't have two orientations on the same page. I can scroll down and view that the next page is still in the portrait orientation.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Inserting predefined headers &amp; footers</strong></h2><div>It is sometimes useful to include certain information on every page in your document. For this, you may want to use Word's header and footer tools. Once you have created your header or footer, that information will by default appear on all pages in your document. I have a document open, and I want to add a header. To insert a built-in header, I click on the Insert tab, and in the Header &amp; Footer toolset, I click on Header.</div><div> </div><div>This opens up the menu of various headers that I can choose from. I can also use the scroll bar to scroll down a bit to view more options. I want to add the title of the document and the author's name in my header, so I'll choose the Filigree option, and the header is inserted into the document with the title of the document and the author automatically inserted.</div><div> </div><div>The header information is pulled from the document properties. If there's no information, Word will put placeholders you can edit manually. Also, notice that whenever you insert a header, the Header &amp; Footer tab will be activated. To insert a built-in footer, under the Header &amp; Footer tab and in the Header &amp; Footer toolset, click on the footer.</div><div> </div><div>This opens up the menu where you have various footer options. Again, you can use the scroll bar to scroll down to view different options and styles. I want the date to be inserted into the footer, so I'll click on ViewMaster (Horizontal). And now the footer is inserted into the document with the page number and the field to insert the date. I click on the Date field, and a down arrow appears. I click on it to open up the calendar. You can choose any date you would like to be displayed in your footer. For now, I'll just choose October 21st, and now October 21st, 2021 has been inserted into the footer.</div><div> </div><div>You are also able to easily navigate between the header and footer. To do this, under the Header &amp; Footer tab and in the navigation toolset, you can click on Go to Header and this will bring you to the header.</div><div> </div><div>If you want to go to the footer, you click on Go to Footer, and you are automatically brought to the footer. You can also navigate between the pages by clicking on Next or Previous, which will jump you in this case to the next footer because I'm currently in that area.</div><div> </div><div>If you were to choose to be in the header, it would do the same thing for the header. So I can click on Go to Header, and I can click on Previous and I'm brought to the previous header. If you'd like to edit your header, in the Header &amp; Footer toolset, click on Header and at the bottom of the menu you have options to edit the header or remove the header.</div><div> </div><div>I'll click on Edit Header, and then I can use my keyboard to type in another word - I'll type in "Homotic" - and now I can scroll down in the document, and I can confirm that the header has been changed throughout the whole document. You can also edit the footer. So I'll click into the footer, and then I'll click on Footer in the Header &amp; Footer toolset, which opens up the menu.</div><div> </div><div>Again, at the bottom of this menu you have the options to edit the footer or remove the footer. This time, I will remove the footer, and now the footer has been removed from the document. Again, I can scroll down to confirm the changes in the footer. To exit the Header &amp; Footer tools, I click on Close Header &amp; Footer in the Close toolset, and now the header and footer areas are closed.</div><div> </div><div>You can also use your mouse to reopen the header and footer by scrolling up to the top of a page and double clicking in the header area. You can also double click on the bottom of the page to open up the header and footer area. To close the area using your mouse, simply double click back in the main area of your document, and the header and footer areas are now closed.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Creating custom headers &amp; footers</strong></h2><div>If you have specific information that you would like to include in your document header and footer, you can insert custom information. Learn how to insert and customize your headers and footers with Word. I have my document open in Word and I want to add a custom header and footer. First, I will scroll down to page 2, and then I will double click in the header area to easily display the header and footer.</div><div> </div><div>Now I will scroll down to the bottom of the page and click into the footer area. To insert custom information here, in the Header &amp; Footer tab, and in the Insert toolset, click on Date &amp; Time. This opens up the Date and Time window, where you have options to choose how you would like to display the date, the time, or the date and the time. Let's click to display the date and the time, and then click OK.</div><div> </div><div>The date and time have been inserted into the footer. I can scroll up and confirm that it has been inserted onto all the pages. And now I'll click back into the header. If you want to quickly insert information about your document, click on Document Info, which opens up a menu. In the menu, you can choose to insert the Author, the File Name, the File Path or the Document Title. I'll insert the author, and now the author's name has been successfully inserted into the header.</div><div> </div><div>And now I'll double click in the center of the section to deselect the author name, and then you can also click on Quick Parts to open up the dropdown menu, and hover my mouse over Document Property to open up another menu where you have more options to insert items such as an Abstract, Comments or the Company.</div><div> </div><div>I'll insert Company, which inserts a field and I can type in the company name. And I'll double click to deselect the Company section. To delete an item from the header, click on the item you want to delete - I'll delete the company - and then press the Backspace key until it is deleted.</div><div> </div><div>To format an item in the header, select the item - I'll select the name - and then the mini toolbar opens where you have options to format the text. For example, I can change the font - let's change it to Arial.</div><div> </div><div>I can also increase the size, and I can change the color. I'll change it to red. And now, I'll click away to close the mini toolbar and deselect the text. Word also allows you to add an image to the header or the footer. To insert a picture from your device, in the Insert toolset click on Pictures, which opens the Insert Picture window. [Video description begins] The File Explorer window titled 'Insert Picture' opens with the navigation menu on the left, the File name and Type fields at the bottom, and the "Insert" and "Cancel" buttons on the bottom right. [Video description ends] I know that the picture that I want to insert is located on my desktop, so I click on Desktop and then I click on the image.</div><div> </div><div>Once the image is selected, I click on Insert, and the image is now inserted into the header. You can resize the image by placing your cursor over a point on the image, and I will just drag it in to decrease the size of it so it doesn't take up too much room.</div><div> </div><div>Notice that the Picture Format tab automatically is activated, and in this tab I can choose to edit the picture further. But for now, I'll leave it as it is. To relocate an image in the header, I'll click on the Header &amp; Footer tab, and in the Position toolset, I'll click on Insert Alignment Tab. This opens up the Alignment Tab, where I can choose the alignment.</div><div> </div><div>I'll align it to the right, and then I click OK to apply the changes, and now the image is on the right side of the header. Also in the Position toolset, you can set the distance of the header from the top of the page. I can click on the down arrow button to decrease it to 1 cm, as well as adjust the footer from the bottom of the page. Let's increase it by clicking on the up arrow button to 1.4 cm.</div><div> </div><div>If you would like to have different header and footers depending on the page, then the Options toolset will help you. First, I'll scroll back up to the first page and then click into the header. If you want to have a different header on the first page, check Different First Page, and you could format your own header for the first page. This could be handy if the first page is a cover page. I will uncheck it for now because I want the header to appear on the first page.</div><div> </div><div>You can also choose the odd pages to be different from the even pages by checking Different Odd &amp; Even Pages. You may have noticed that the Header section has changed to Odd Page Header. For now, I'll uncheck it so that all the pages are the same. Lastly, Show Document Text is automatically checked. This is handy to visualize how the document is displayed with the header, footer and content.</div><div> </div><div>If you only want to focus on the header and footer then uncheck this box, but we'll leave it checked for now. Then, in the Navigation toolset, you can jump between the header and footer by clicking on Go to Header or Go to Footer. You can also jump between the next header or footer, depending on which one you have selected. To close the header and footer, in the Close toolset click on Close Header &amp; Footer.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Saving &amp; re-using a header</strong></h2><div>If you have created a customized header or footer in Word, you can save it and import it directly into a completely different document. This is very useful if you have a particular company or organization style that you want to use in all of your official documents. I have a Word document open and I have created a custom header with my name, the company logo and a vertical line.</div><div> </div><div>I will double click on the top of the page to access the Header area and open the Header &amp; Footer tab with all of the tools. It is good to know that all headers don't have to only be in the Header area. Headers can also include elements that go outside the header space, such as a sidebar, but do not interfere with the elements in the document body. To save the customize header, first select the header by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+A.</div><div> </div><div>Notice that this only selects elements in the header and not the content in the main area of the document. Then, in the Header &amp; Footer toolset, click on Header to open up a menu. At the bottom of the menu, click on Save Selection to Header Gallery, which opens up the Create New Building Block window. I can use my keyboard to set a name. By default, the gallery is set to Headers and the category is set to General.</div><div> </div><div>Then I can also type in a description, and I can choose to change Save in and Options as well, but for now, we'll leave them the same. Then I click OK to apply the changes and close the window. Now let's add this custom header to another document. I have another document open already, so I will hover my cursor over the Word icon in the taskbar and then click on the miniature of the document to activate the window.</div><div> </div><div>Now in this document, I click on the Insert tab, and in the Header &amp; Footer toolset, I click on Header to open up the gallery. I can use the scroll bar to browse the gallery, and at the bottom of the gallery, in the General section, is the header that we just created. I'll click on the header to insert it into the document.</div><div> </div><div>Notice that the themes which were used in creating the header are not saved. To close the header, I click on Close Header and Footer. To manage the customize header, I'll click on the Insert tab and in the Header &amp; Footer toolset, I click on Header again. I'll then scroll to the bottom and then I will right click on our custom header. This opens up a menu where we have the options to Insert at Current Document Position, Edit Properties, Organize and Delete or Add Gallery to Quick Access Toolbar.</div><div> </div><div>I'll click on Organize and Delete, which opens up the Building Blocks Organizer window. [Video description begins] The window displays the Building blocks gallery on the left, and a preview of the selected building block on the right. [Video description ends] Our custom header is currently selected, and at the bottom of the window we have options to edit the properties, delete or insert. To delete the header, I'll click on Delete. A Microsoft Word window will open, asking me if I'm sure I want to delete the selected building block, and I click Yes. And now the custom header has been deleted from the gallery. I'll then click on Close to close the window. Notice that the deleted header will not be removed from the document, so it is possible to save this again.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Inserting page numbers</strong></h2><div>If you want to keep track of where you are in a document or if you want to refer to a particular section, page numbers are extremely useful. In Word, you can insert page numbers into your header and footer areas. It is also possible to customize the style and appearance of the page numbers that you have inserted. I am working on a document and I want to insert some page numbers to help me keep track of my location in the document.</div><div> </div><div>To find the page number options, first click on the Insert tab and in the Header &amp; Footer toolset, click on Page Number. This opens up a menu with options to insert a page number at the top of the page, bottom of the page, in the page margins, or in the current position, meaning that it'll only be inserted on the current page you are on.</div><div> </div><div>I'll insert the page number at the top of the page, so from the menu that opens from when I hover my mouse, I'll click on the first option, which inserts the page number on the left side of the header. I can also edit the format of the page number. So with the page number selected, in the Header &amp; Footer tab and in the Header &amp; Footer toolset, I can click on Page Number and from the menu I can then click on Format Page Numbers.</div><div> </div><div>This opens up the Page Number Format window, and in the Number Format section, I can open up a menu to choose how I'd like the numbers to be displayed. For example, I'll click on the second option. You can also check this box if you wish to include the chapter number, which activates other styling options as well. If you want to deactivate it, simply click on the checkbox. Then in the Page numbering section, by default it is set to continue from previous section.</div><div> </div><div>However, I would like to start the page numbering at a different number than 1, so I'll click Start at and I want to set it to start at 0, so I click the down arrow button and then I click OK to apply the changes and close the window. If the 0 appears on the first page, in the Options toolset we'll check Different First Page and the 0 is now hidden from the first page.</div><div> </div><div>I can then scroll down to the next page in the document to confirm that the page number has been inserted with the changes that I have applied. If you want to reset the numbering to 1 at a certain chapter or section of your document, we can do so with page breaks. First, move your insertion point to the chapter section. I will scroll down to chapter 4, and I will click before the heading. Then, in the Layout tab and in the Page Setup toolset, I click on Breaks, and from the menu I click on Continuous under the Section Breaks section.</div><div> </div><div>Now you may have noticed that the page number has disappeared. It actually has restarted numbering as if this was the first page, which in our case is an invisible zero. I can scroll down to view the next page and confirm that it is numbered as page 1. I'll now double click in the Header area to activate it and select the page number.</div><div> </div><div>Then I will right click, and from the menu click on Format Page Numbers, which opens up the Page Number Format window. In the Page numbering section and the Start at field, I will increase the number by clicking on the up arrow button. Let's increase it to 2. Then I'll click OK, and now this page number would start at t2, while this page number is 3.</div><div> </div><div>We can also show the number of pages in each section too. I'll click into the header besides the page number, and then in the Header &amp; Footer tab and in the Insert toolset, I click on Quick Parts. This opens a menu where I click on Field. The Field window opens, and in the Categories list, I click the down arrow and from the menu I click on Numbering. Now in the Field names list I click on Section Pages, then I click on OK to apply the changes and close the window. A 2 has been inserted indicating that there are two pages in the section. To remove page numbers, in the Header &amp; Footer toolset click on Page Number and at the bottom of the menu, click on Remove Page Numbers. And now the page numbers have been removed from the entire document. I can scroll up to confirm that the changes have been applied.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Customizing your paragraph outline &amp; color</strong></h2><div>If you want to make a paragraph stand out, a border may be just what you need. You can change the appearance of your document by adding paragraph borders and fill effects. Word allows you to adjust the style, color, thickness, and even the location of your border, as well as apply color effects to your selection. I have a Word document open, and I want to add borders in a fill color to highlight the first paragraph in the mission section.</div><div> </div><div>To add the borders to the paragraph, I'll first select the paragraph by triple clicking on it, and then, under the Home tab and in the Paragraph toolset, I click on Borders to open up the menu. I can hover my mouse over any of the options to get a preview in the document. I'll click on Outside Borders, so that there is a border around the entire paragraph. You can also insert a horizontal line. This is handy to help divide the page or paragraphs.</div><div> </div><div>To do this, I'll first click to select an insertion point. I'll click before the last paragraph, and then I open the Borders menu again and towards the bottom of the menu, I click on Horizontal Line. Now, a horizontal line has been inserted above the last paragraph. Now, we can also add a Fill color to the first paragraph with the border.</div><div> </div><div>I'll select the paragraph again by triple clicking on it, then to access the options to customize the borders and shading, click on Borders again and at the bottom of the menu, click on Borders and Shading. This opens up the Borders and Shading window, and under the Borders tab, I can select a setting. Let's select Shadow. I can also select a style. I'll scroll down a bit and I'll select an option with a thick and thin line.</div><div> </div><div>I can change the color by clicking on the down arrow to open the menu. I'll choose dark red. And lastly, I can choose the width. I click on the arrow to open up the menu and I'll select 4.5 pt for the width. Notice that there is a preview on the right side of the window to view the changes that we are making. You can also choose where you would like to apply this border.</div><div> </div><div>I'll open the menu by clicking on the down arrow, and you have the options to apply it to the text or the paragraph. I want to apply it to the paragraph, so I select this option. Then I click on the Options button to open up the Borders and Shading Options window.</div><div> </div><div>I can choose how far apart I would like the text to be from the border. Let's increase the top to 2 points by clicking on the up arrow, and we'll decrease the left side to 3 points by clicking on the down arrow. Then I'll click OK to apply the changes. Then, to customize the shading options, I click on the Shading tab and in the Fill section, I'll select a color by opening up the menu - I'll choose light yellow - and then I'll choose the pattern style, I'll choose 10%, and the color, I'll choose orange.</div><div> </div><div>Again, notice the preview on the right side of the window, as well as the Apply to option. I'll click OK to apply the changes and close the window. Now I'll click away to deselect the text, and notice we have successfully applied a border to the paragraph with a shadow, a fill and a pattern. To remove borders and fill color, I'll select the paragraph by triple clicking on it, and then in the Font toolset, I click on Clear All Formatting. Notice that the horizontal line must be removed manually, so I'll click at the end of the line and then I'll press my Backspace key twice to delete the line.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Customizing your page outline &amp; color</strong></h2><div>Adding a page border and fill effect can dramatically change the appearance of your document in just a few clicks. Using the border and fill tools, you can apply theme, standard or custom colors to your document, and design interesting and stylish borders to make your document more attractive. I want to change the page color in this Word document. First, I will select the whole document by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+A.</div><div> </div><div>Then I can access the Page Background options by clicking on the Design tab, and then in the Page Background toolset, we have the option to add a watermark, change the page color or change the page border. Since I want to change the page color, I will click on Page Color to open up the menu. We can choose between Theme Colors, Standard Colors and Custom Colors. I will apply the light yellow from the theme color.</div><div> </div><div>Remember to choose colors that allow the text to remain legible. We can also apply fill effects. I'll click on Page Color again, and then at the bottom of the menu, I'll click on Fill Effects. This opens up the Fill Effects window, where we have four tabs: Gradient, Texture, Pattern and Picture. I want to apply a gradient, so I'll remain in the Gradient tab and then I'll select Two colors under the Color section.</div><div> </div><div>Color 1 is set to the light yellow, and Color 2 is set to white. These colors can easily be changed by clicking on the dropdown arrow to open up the color menu. But for now, I'll leave them the same, so I'll click away to close this menu. In the Shading styles, you have the option to choose the direction of the gradient. For now, I'll leave it as Horizontal. I can also choose a variant.</div><div> </div><div>I'll select the first option for now. Notice that there is a preview of the gradient in the Sample section. Then I click OK to apply the changes and close the window. I'll click away to deselect the text, and then I can scroll down a bit to view the gradient. It is good to note that it might be easier to use Word with a white background, even if the final document will have another color background.</div><div> </div><div>To customize your document even further, you can add a page border. Under the Design tab and in the Page Background toolset, I click on Page Borders. This opens up the Borders and Shading window, and in the Page Border tab, as shown before, you can choose the settings, the style, the color and the width. In addition, you can even add a border using ClipArt. I'll open the ClipArt menu by clicking on the down arrow, and I will use a scroll bar to scroll down to view the different designs.</div><div> </div><div>Then, I select a design. In the Apply to section, I can select where I want to apply the border in the document. I'll click on the down arrow to open the menu where I have the options to apply the border to the Whole Document, This Section, This section First page only, or This section All except the first page. I will choose 'This section, - All except the first page'.</div><div> </div><div>This is handy to distinguish titles or cover pages. Lastly, you can use the Preview section to visualize the borders. I can click to deactivate or activate borders in the selection by toggling on the buttons. Then I click OK to apply the changes and close the window. Now the border has been applied to this page, and I can scroll up to the first page to confirm that it does not have a border. To remove the page customization, click on Page Color, and from the menu click on No Color. I'll scroll down to confirm that the color has been removed.</div><div> </div><div>To remove the page borders, click on Page Borders, and in the Borders and Shading window, under the Page Border tab and in the Setting section, click on None. Then click OK to apply the changes and close the window. Now, the border has been successfully removed from the document.</div><div> </div><h2><strong>Inserting a watermark</strong></h2><div>In Word, you can add an image or graphic to the background of your document. This is known as a watermark. This tool is particularly useful if you want to indicate that a document is official or confidential. You can apply a watermark to multiple pages in your document. I have my document open, and I would like to add a watermark. To access the Watermark tool, I click on the Design tab and in the Page Background toolset, I click on Watermark to open up the gallery.</div><div> </div><div>I can use the scroll bar on the right side of the menu to scroll through the different options. It's possible to get more options at <a href="http://office.com/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://office.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1760317556098000&amp;usg=AOvVaw35JtiuKXOOt-nFraMP9ZWv" rel="noopener">office.com</a>. I'll then click on a ASAP 1 to insert this watermark. Now, I can scroll through the document to confirm that it has been successfully inserted. You can also insert a custom watermark. To do this, open up the Watermark tool again and at the bottom of the menu, click on Custom Watermark.</div><div> </div><div>This opens up the Printed Watermark window. Text watermark is already selected by default. The language is currently set to English (United States) because that is the current language of the document, but you can easily change it by clicking on the down arrow. The text has different default options, such as 'CONFIDENTIAL' or 'DO NOT COPY', but you can also type in your own. I'll press the Backspace key, and I'll type in the company name "Homotic".</div><div> </div><div>Then I can change the font by opening up the menu - I'll change it to Cambria - and we can change the size as well. I'll click on the down arrow and I'll use the scroll bar to scroll through and choose 90 as the font size. Then, I'll click on the down arrow to choose a color, and I will choose light red from the theme colors. Lastly, you can choose your layout. You have the choice between Diagonal and Horizontal.</div><div> </div><div>I'll leave it on Diagonal for now. Then I click Apply, and the custom watermark is shown in the document. I then click Close to close the window. If you prefer to use an image as a watermark, you can do this with Word too. This could be useful if you want to insert your company logo. To insert an image watermark, click on Watermark and then click on Custom Watermark again. In the Printed Watermark window, click on Picture watermark. Then, click on the Select Picture button.</div><div> </div><div>The Insert Pictures window opens and I click From a file, and I know that the image I want to insert [Video description begins] The File Explorer window titled 'Insert Picture' opens with the navigation menu on the left, the File name and Type fields at the bottom, and the "Insert" and "Cancel" buttons on the bottom right. [Video description ends] is currently on my desktop and in my Files folder, and then I click on the Homotic logo. Then I click Insert. Now I can choose a scale - I'll click on the down arrow and I'll choose the scale of 200%, and I will keep Washout checked. I then click Apply, and I can just move the window over just a bit so that we can fully view the logo as a watermark. If you want to remove the watermark in the Printed Watermark window, click on No watermark, then click Apply. This has successfully removed the watermark from the document. I'll then click on Close to close the window.</div></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 11, 2025</p><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fshaping-documents-in-word-365.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fshaping-documents-in-word-365.html&amp;via=_Aindien&amp;text=Shaping%20documents%20in%20Word%20365" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://aindien.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://aindien.com/critical-security-concepts.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Critical Security Concepts</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://aindien.com/using-tables-in-word-365.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Using tables in Word 365 </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-10-11T22:14" class="feed__date">October 11, 2025</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/using-tables-in-word-365.html" class="invert">Using tables in Word 365</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2025-10-09T20:31" class="feed__date">October 9, 2025</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/designing-and-shaping-email-in-outlook-365.html" class="invert">Designing &amp; Shaping email in Outlook 365</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><style type="text/css">#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }
