Microsoft has put several of them singly in their menus but the most often used ones are in this tool.</p><figure class="wp-image-456 size-full"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/AdminTools12.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools12-xs.png 300w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools12-sm.png 480w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools12-md.png 768w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools12-lg.png 1024w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools12-xl.png 1360w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools12-2xl.png 1600w" alt="computer management tools in windows 10" width="793" height="576"></figure>computer management tools in windows 10<p></p><p>Here is the main starting screen and it is impressive in what it can do. If you want to diagnose a system then this is a good place to start. Managing your disks is also accomplished here. Using the Event Viewer or Task Scheduler can also be started here.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Event Viewer</strong></h3><p>Let me start off by telling you what the event viewer really is. It is a collection of logs within the Windows operating system. Logs of what you may ask? Well, the logs are of just about every event that happens. They can be of errors or just a program shutting down and everything in between.</p><p>Most of the time we want to use the event viewer to see error logs. This helps in diagnosing issues. So the event viewer is used to fix problems.</p><p>However, the [Event Viewer] is one of the most confusing of the computer management tools in Windows 10. It is just not easy to decipher logs. I will try to help here with my explanation.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Starting The Event Viewer</strong></h3><p>In Windows 10 it is much easier to find the event viewer. In past editions of Windows you had to through all kinds of trouble to get someone to it when they did not already know how. All you have to do is right click the start menu button and then select the event viewer from the list. It is the 4th option from the top. Nice and easy! It should look like this.</p><figure class="wp-image-443 size-full"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/EventViewer1.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/EventViewer1-xs.png 300w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/EventViewer1-sm.png 480w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/EventViewer1-md.png 768w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/EventViewer1-lg.png 1024w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/EventViewer1-xl.png 1360w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/EventViewer1-2xl.png 1600w" alt="computer management tools in windows 10" width="786" height="550"></figure>computer management tools in windows 10<p></p><p>You can also get here by going to the [Control Panel] and then clicking on [Administrative Tools].</p><p>Another way is to just use the search bar and Cortana. Just type or say [Event] and it comes right up.</p><p>As you can see there are 3 different sections to this window. The far left is your navigation portion. In the center you have the Overview and Summary part. On the far right you have additional tasks that give the Event Viewer its functionality. The first thing I would do is maximize your window because this little utility packs a lot of information.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Administrative View</strong></h3><p>The first activity to look at is the administrative view. On the far left click on the [Custom Views] folder. Then in middle window click on [Administrative Events]. In a second you will see lots of warnings and errors. Don't panic, every system is like this. Microsoft should really redo the message system here because it makes you think your system is about to crash.</p><p>It is not. On a freshly installed computer you still see the same things.</p><figure class="wp-image-444 size-full"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/EventViewer2.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/EventViewer2-xs.png 300w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/EventViewer2-sm.png 480w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/EventViewer2-md.png 768w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/EventViewer2-lg.png 1024w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/EventViewer2-xl.png 1360w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/EventViewer2-2xl.png 1600w" alt="computer management tools in windows 10" width="908" height="629"></figure>computer management tools in windows 10<p></p><p>If you double click the error messages you will see messages come up that describes the issues. They cab be from various things like a program not loading or a website that was down. It just doesn't mean something is wrong with your computer.</p><p>Now what you do want to look for here instead of the error messages is any of the messages that say [Critical]. I did not have any to show you but then I guess that is a good thing too. Those are the messages that you should be concerned with.</p><p>Also keep in mind that the [Administrative View] that we are in is a combination of your other logs. You can go even further with the details by clicking individual logs and looking for those messages.</p><p>The right hand side has some additional information for any selected event in the center panel. Properties and saving the events are both helpful items.</p><p>For the average person this is really as far as you need to go in this aspect.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Summary Of Views</strong></h4><ul><li><span style="color: #008000;">Use the center panel to look for Critical Warnings</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">For any Critical Warning look at its properties</span></li><li><span style="color: #008000;">Update or re-install any app that is not working correctly if possible</span></li></ul><p> </p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Task Scheduler</strong></h3><p>The task scheduler is the first real practical section I want to talk about. It is one of the best computer management tools in Windows 10 for sure. It is kind of obvious that it schedules tasks, right? Well, what kind of tasks exactly? Tasks such as defragmenting your computer, running a backup script, or shutting down your computer at a certain time are some of your options.</p><p>These are all very easy to do too. You can basically have any program run at a certain time to do something. That sounds pretty cool right. Well it is. I used the [Task Scheduler] to run a backup script on my computer once a week. Oh did I mention that you could just set the scheduled action to repeat? It is a good way to do things.</p><p>Let me show you how it is done.</p><h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Using The Task Scheduler</strong></h4><p>Click on [Task Scheduler]</p><figure class="wp-image-448 size-full"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/AdminTools4.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools4-xs.png 300w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools4-sm.png 480w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools4-md.png 768w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools4-lg.png 1024w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools4-xl.png 1360w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools4-2xl.png 1600w" alt="computer management tools in windows 10" width="985" height="683"></figure>computer management tools in windows 10<p></p><p>As you can see on the far right you have a few different options.

In the center panel you will also see any ongoing tasks that you had going or had forgotten about.</p><p>Select [Create Basic Task]</p><figure class="wp-image-449 size-full"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/AdminTools5.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools5-xs.png 300w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools5-sm.png 480w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools5-md.png 768w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools5-lg.png 1024w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools5-xl.png 1360w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools5-2xl.png 1600w" alt="computer management tools in windows 10" width="690" height="487"></figure>computer management tools in windows 10<p></p><p>This is where it all happens.

There is no doubt it is one of more useful computer management tools in Windows 10. It can give you detailed insights into your system if you want to fine tune it. If not, it can give you a solid overview of how your system is going.</p><p>Use it to check how hard your CPU is working and how much memory you have left after running a few programs.

That could change if I start up a game or something else intensive. It is just important to know where to look if you experience any performance issues. To get a more detailed and visual view of your resources just click that link at the top called [Open Resource Monitor].</p><figure class="wp-image-462 size-full"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/AdminTools17-1.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools17-1-xs.png 300w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools17-1-sm.png 480w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools17-1-md.png 768w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools17-1-lg.png 1024w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools17-1-xl.png 1360w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools17-1-2xl.png 1600w" alt="computer management tools in windows 10" width="1200" height="670"></figure>computer management tools in windows 10<p></p><p>Here is how the Resource Monitor looks on my system. You will notice there are sections for CPU, Disk, Network, and Memory. Either of these sections can be customized so you see what you want to see. I immediately see some issues I need to take care of.</p><p>In the CPU section I see ConsoleService.exe by SmartDeploy which is something I no longer have a license for and can't use. So I need to uninstall it so free up those resources.</p><p>My Disk category looks fine. I see no issues there.</p><p>The same goes for the <a href="http://aindien.com/networking-basics-applications-network-devices.html">Network Devices</a> category, no real issues there.</p><p>In my memory category I see Chrome always takes a lot of CPU and memory.</p><p>Looking at your system this way is easy. When I diagnose systems at work that are reported as slow, this is the first place I look. I look for anything in these categories that takes a lot of the resources.</p><p>If you see something that looks unusual you can investigate. Just search on the web how much memory Chrome or another app is suppose to use. Identifying some malware and viruses is also possible through this method.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Device Manager</strong></h3><p>To check on your actual hardware this is one of the best ways. This section manages how the devices in your system communicates with Windows. These <a href="http://aindien.com/computer-networking-networking-hardware.html">hardware devices</a> use device drivers. Device drivers are small pieces of software that make the hardware function.</p><figure class="wp-image-463 size-full"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/AdminTools18.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools18-xs.png 300w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools18-sm.png 480w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools18-md.png 768w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools18-lg.png 1024w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools18-xl.png 1360w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools18-2xl.png 1600w" alt="computer management tools in windows 10" width="853" height="511"></figure>computer management tools in windows 10<p></p><p>This is the Device Manager window. Among the computer management tools in Windows 10 it is one of the least used I believe. Some do not understand it very well at all. It does have a strange appearance.</p><p>Different categories are not very clear either. In this section the main thing to look out for are any yellow or red warning signs. That means a piece of hardware will not work right. The device driver is not installed correctly.</p><p>There is an option to update the software driver for each of these devices. It is almost always better to go to the manufacturer's web site and download the latest copy of the driver to your computer right there.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Disk Management</strong></h3><p>This section is under [Storage] and right below the [Device Manager] section. There is not a lot you will do in here on a regular basis. It is the least used of the computer management tools in Windows 10. Most people do not do much with their disks is the reason.  I did want to mention one thing about this area. If you add an additional disk for storage to your computer you add it to your system through this window.</p><figure class="wp-image-464 size-full"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/AdminTools19.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools19-xs.png 300w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools19-sm.png 480w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools19-md.png 768w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools19-lg.png 1024w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools19-xl.png 1360w, https://aindien.com/media/posts/15/responsive/AdminTools19-2xl.png 1600w" alt="computer management tools in windows 10" width="859" height="727"></figure>computer management tools in windows 10<p></p><p> </p><p>You can see from my computer here that I need some more storage. I will look to find the type of disk I want to buy and order it. After I have put my disk in I will just add it using this management tool.</p><p>To add to your system you just choose the [Scan Disk] option, [Mark Partition As Active], [Add Drive Letter], and that is probably it. It could be different for you depending on where you get your disk and what has already been done with it.</p><p>For example, you could have to [Format] your disk and add a [Volume] to it also but then I am just guessing. Those are some things that could pop up. Hopefully I have given you an idea of what to expect.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Conclusion </strong></h3><p>As you can see the computer management tools in Windows 10 are quite useful. It does a multitude of tasks and can take a bit to get used to. These are among the very best utilities that Windows has to offer. I would advice getting to know them well enough to be familiar with them if something goes wrong with your computer.</p><p>If you missed my previous articles they were about C++ and Ransomware so take a look here if your interested:</p><p><a href="http://aindien.com/how-to-read-data-from-a-file-with-c.html">http://aindien.com/how-to-read-data-from-a-file-with-c/</a></p><p>or</p><p><a href="http://aindien.com/how-to-protect-yourself-from-ransomware.html">http://aindien.com/how-to-protect-yourself-from-ransomware/</a></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 19, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://aindien.com/windows/">Windows</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fhow-to-use-the-computer-management-tools-in-windows-10.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fhow-to-use-the-computer-management-tools-in-windows-10.html&amp;via=_Aindien&amp;text=How%20To%20Use%20The%20Computer%20Management%20Tools%20In%20Windows%2010" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://aindien.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://aindien.com/how-to-read-data-from-a-file-with-c.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> How To Read Data From A File With C++</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://aindien.com/how-the-osi-model-works.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> How The OSI Model Works </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-02-09T14:58" class="feed__date">February 9, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/troubleshooting-a-computer-network.html" class="invert">Troubleshooting A Computer Network</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-06-26T12:56" class="feed__date">June 26, 2018</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/network-management-guide.html" class="invert">Network Management Guide</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-04-17T07:44" class="feed__date">April 17, 2018</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/getting-started-with-windows-10-accounts.html" class="invert">Getting Started With Windows 10 Accounts</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-a069787e-7e42-46d9-add7-27a263bf2775"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=a069787e-7e42-46d9-add7-27a263bf2775"></script><link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><style type="text/css">#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }
