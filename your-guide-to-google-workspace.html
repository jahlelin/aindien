This is great software and for many people it is better than Microsoft Office. That's how good it is. Being cloud based makes it very convenient so I recommend you take a look at it.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsg1"><span style="color: #236fa1;">Browser Based</span></h3><p>The whole Google apps system is browser based and this means mainstream web browsers too. We are talking about Internet Explorer, Edge, Firefox, and Chrome of course. You should stick to these main browsers so that you will not have any issues with certain features working.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsg2"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Google Docs Features</strong></span></h3><p>What Google Docs lacks in general option in how to do things, it totally makes up in subtle but well thought out uses for their software. What I mean by that is there may not be five ways to do everything so every person can do things according to their preference. Instead, though, there are much less ways to do a particular task.</p><p>To offset this Docs has several really cool features that are unique to it. However, I want to point out that even though it has less features than some types of <a href="http://aindien.com/11-clever-tips-for-word-2016.html">productivity software</a> it is always getting more features and in constant development.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsg3"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>How Google Docs Work</strong></span></h3><p>The first thing you need to do is log in to your Google account. This is on Google's homepage and several other places too. Once you are logged in then go to your Drive area that will hold all of your newly created files. You can also get to Docs by going directly to it.</p><p>You will notice the big blue button at the top left because that is where you go to create new files. Just do this:</p><ul><li><span style="color: #008080;">Click blue button</span></li><li><span style="color: #008080;">Select Google Docs</span></li><li><span style="color: #008080;">Click blank document</span></li></ul><p>Your new document will open and you will then see the familiar options for most word processors.</p><p>Now when you create a new document you can just create a blank document like we first did or you can create a document using a template. This means it will already be styled and formatted a little and is helpful if you need a certain type of document such as a report or an essay.</p><p>There are many other options also so just choose what fits your need the best. Using a template is also nice because it saves you time in creating your document from scratch.</p><p>Since there is also not a save button using Docs by Google, it gets saved constantly by the system which makes that a very nice feature. There is no more losing your work because your computer crashes and you lose your work.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsg4"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Formatting Documents</strong></span></h3><p>Formatting is easily done using Google Docs just like with any other word processing suite. There is a nice toolbar which has every option that you would ever need and furthermore you have the menu system up to that will do the same thing.</p><p>If you prefer the menu system then just use the [Format] option because it will do the same thing as the icons down below.</p><p>Speaking of the icons, you can see they are all grouped together in usual ways. Though they are in a slightly different order than other suites, it is easy to see their function. From the icon bar you can print, change your font, change font size, make words bold, center the text, and even make bullet points quite easily. There is a lot more that you can do but those are the usual basics which most people will need.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsg5"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Finding Extra Fonts</strong></span></h3><p>Google Docs has a lot of different font options that are quick to see and use. However, if you still do not see something that you like then you can always click [More font...] at the bottom of the font list. There are a lot more here and what is really cool is that you can sort them by their popularity.</p><p>It is nice to see what is currently popular among others. The list to the right is also very useful as it is your list of fonts that you like and have used. This makes keeping track of them very easy which is a useful feature.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsg6"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Display Styles</strong></span></h3><p>There are some different styles to apply to your writing. While there are not as many as some suites they are still nice. You also have the option of saving your style and making it a template which is a useful feature. If you do a lot of writing I would recommend that you do that because it will save you time.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsg7"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Lists</strong></span></h3><p>We have the usual list options here as well and that is always nice. Google Docs has several varieties of bulleted and numbered lists to choose from. They are easy to apply and create because you can just hit the icon for each. If you click the tiny little arrow next to either of them you will see six different options for both bulleted and numbered lists. They are all nice to choose from and you can click on one of the styles to select them.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsg8"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Inserting Content</strong></span></h3><p>The insertion of most content into your document is really quite easy. Just look at your menu and choose the [Insert] tab. You have many options to choose from including links, images, equations, and tables. This makes your document look nice and help the user that is reading it to understand easier what your message is about.</p><p>If you insert images keep in mind that generally around 2 mb is your limit for an image so if some are larger than that then you will need to reduce their size some.</p><p>If you need to do links and are not experienced at this their is a useful trick to it. You should go to the site that you want to link to and high the address at the top in the address bar. Once it is highlighted you just copy it to your clipboard and in your document you paste it in to the link box.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsg9"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Document Management</strong></span></h3><p>Google makes managing your documents easy like most word processing suites. There is the usual list of opening, renaming, and moving options here as well. Nothing too exciting about that anyway.</p><p>There are a couple features that stand out and I want to mention them. The first is the [Share] option which makes it easy to send a friend the copy of your document.</p><p>You can just enter your friend's email address and that is it. It is a good feature if you need to collaborate with someone like an editor to fix your grammar mistakes. I know nothing about that, really I don't.</p><p>The other cool feature I wanted to show you was their [Revision] option. This makes it nice to see how your work has changed and to correct things if you have suddenly gone off on a huge tangent in your new fiction novel.</p><p>It lists my two revisions there and I would just select them to see the differences. They open right up depending on which one you select.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsga"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>The Toolbox</strong></span></h3><p>The tool section of just about any app these days has the most useful items for me. It is also where I go to for every document that I write because there is always something I need from there before I finalize any document that I write.</p><p>It has a decent spellchecker you should always use. While any automated spellchecker can help you just remember they might not catch every mistake you make.</p><p>The word count feature is always nice because it can tell you where you are at quickly. The [Voice typing] feature is also quite handy as it will dictate for you. It is not perfect but it can save you time initially as you fill out your document. Then you just go back and check for errors but you will have still saved time. I do encourage you to try this option out.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsgb"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Web Publishing</strong></span></h3><p>When you finish your document there is another option for sharing it and that is publishing it somewhere like a website or social media.</p><p>This is also under the [File] tab on the menu and you just select the [Publish to the Web] option. You can use the link tab there to share with others on any type of social media. The</p><p>tab is there so you can insert this link to your document on a website which is pretty cool.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsgc"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Use Operators In Searching</strong></span></h3><p>This is your main Google Docs page and its also called your home page. If you have dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of documents stored here don't go scrolling down and looking one by one. Use the search bar at the top and use Google's own search operators to help you out. The basics in that link are at the top but there are more advanced options down below.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsgd"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Downloading Your Documents</strong></span></h3><p>Downloading any document is an easy task to do and it makes your document available offline. This especially useful if you are going to be without internet for a while and need to keep working.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #008080;">From the menu select File</span></li><li><span style="color: #008080;">Then choose Download as...</span></li><li><span style="color: #008080;">Now choose what format you would like</span></li></ul><p>It will then go to your default download folder wherever that is for you.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsge"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Uploading Documents</strong></span></h3><p>Once you have worked on a document offline you will need to get it back into the Google Docs system. This is easy to do as well and I will show you how.</p><p>Select the little folder in the picture that is at the far right.</p><p>Once you have done that you will then select the [Upload] tab on the far right.</p><p>Once you click upload you can either drag a document in there or browse to some folder and select it. Easy!</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsgf"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Use Templates</strong></span></h3><p>Templates are one of those features that everyone should use. If you create documents then you should be using templates because it is that simple. I mentioned them earlier but I wanted to go in a bit more detail here. They are on your Docs homepage and labeled nicely so it is easy to see what they are.</p><p>This is the first page of the template section and you can see there are a lot of options. Resumes and letters are probably the most often created form of document and therefore that is why they are at the top here. The next time you need to create one of these types then just browse through a few of these to find what you like.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsgg"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Table Of Contents</strong></span></h3><p>If you have a very long document that includes many sections then it would be very handy to use a table of contents. You can do this by adding it as an add-on. Let me show you how.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #008080;">With your document open, select Add-ons from the menu.</span></li><li><span style="color: #008080;">Then you will choose Get Add-on.</span></li><li><span style="color: #008080;">In the search box, type out table of contents and hit enter.</span></li></ul><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsgh"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Researching Content</strong></span></h3><p>This is my favorite feature of Google Docs because I do a lot of <span style="color: #008080;">research.</span> It is now called the [Explore] option and you get to it from the [Tools] tab in your main menu. It instantly analyzes your document and suggests topics for you to explore.</p><p>You can also just use the search bar too which is very nice. When you use this function you will notice that you do not ever have to leave your document and that means no more switching between pages constantly.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsgi"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Make Footnotes</strong></span></h3><p>This is very easy to do in Google Docs and if you are writing the kind of document that requires them then you are in luck.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #008080;">Select [Insert] from the main menu.</span></li><li><span style="color: #008080;">Choose the [Footnote] option.</span></li><li><span style="color: #008080;">Then just type your footnote out and it goes where it should at the bottom.</span></li></ul><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsgj"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Image Editing</strong></span></h3><p>You can even do images when you are using Google Docs. After you insert one the options to crop and resize will show up and you can make your images look exactly how you like. Just remember not to have them too big or they will not be able to upload.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsgk"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Using Maps</strong></span></h3><p>Maps are similar to images in that you insert them. Most people, however, do not think of inserting a map into their document but its an entirely useful thing to do. You do it just like inserting a picture into your document except that you search by maps or locations. This will bring up maps into your search results and then you just insert that. It is very useful to do that if your document is talking about a location.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsgl"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Keeping Track To Changes In Files</strong></span></h3><p>This will be very important to do if you have multiple people working on the same document. In Google Docs you can monitor the version history of any particular document to see what changes were made.</p><ul><li><span style="color: #008080;">Select File &gt; Version History &gt; See Version History</span></li><li><span style="color: #008080;">Click one of the timestamps to see a previous version of the file.</span></li><li><span style="color: #008080;">Click Restore this version if you want to make it the active version</span></li><li><span style="color: #008080;">You will need Owner or Editor access to see the version history</span></li></ul><p>Google Drive can also do something similar if your documents are already stored there.</p><ul><li>From Drive, click view details at the top right</li><li>Make sure the activity tab is selected to see all of the file's information</li><li>You can select any file in there to see version history</li></ul><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt86gsgm"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Working With Office Files</strong></span></h3><p>Most people have some Office files laying around somewhere, so it is a good idea to know how to work with them from within Google Docs.

Even if it is just social media, you don’t want to be embarrassed. There are many spell check options out there, both paid and free. They all have varying features too. Starting with a free and basic one is a good place to start. </span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ggct8qd62gk"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Enabling Spell Check In Chrome</strong></span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing you want to do is open your Chrome browser. Then, look for the 3-dot menu in the top right. Click settings. Select Advanced and then navigate to Languages. Make sure spell check is enabled. The slider should be moved to the right. You can choose basic or advanced. The basic version is plenty good on its own. I think the advanced might be a bit slower but either way, you can choose whichever you prefer. You probably won’t notice any speed difference. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t have to do much to use it. Once it is on, it checks everything you type in the Chrome browser. This can be Docs, Gmail, or any other site you open with Chrome. Adding other features is easily done. For example, you can add a different language or change a dictionary. </span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open chrome</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click 3-dot menu</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select settings</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click advanced</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigate to languages</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure slider is on the right to enable</span></li></ul><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ggct8qd62gl"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Turning off Spell Check</strong></span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the same process as turning it on. You go to the 3-dot menu and click Settings. Oh the left side of the page, go to Advanced and Languages. Under the Spell Check section, you move the slider to the left. This disables Spell Check.</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open chrome</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click 3-dot menu</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Select settings</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Click advanced</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigate to languages</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure slider is on the left to disable </span></li></ul><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ggct8qd62gm"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Problems With Spell Check</strong></span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Spell Check is not working, there are a few things you can try. Make sure your browser is updated. All kinds of things can stop working when your browser goes too long without updates. You can clear your browser cache. When the cache gets full, it can also cause many problems. Last, don’t use another Spell Check in combination with Chrome. You will get some weird effects like this.</span></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ggct8qd62gn"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article has been about Spell Check in Chrome.

This is because they are not made by Google. So, disabling them is a good test for pictures not showing up and any other issue you have with Chrome. Go back to “Settings” and select “Extensions”. Disable any or all there to test and see if that is the issue.</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Settings</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extensions</span></li></ul><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ggctaoau2ii"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Resetting Chrome</strong></span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, starting over is what it takes to fix issues. If nothing else works, this is one of the last things to try. You will lose previous settings if you do this. However, if you still want, here is how. Go to your settings menu and select “Advanced” on the left side. Go to “Reset and clean up”. Select “Restore settings to their original defaults”. This option will do many of the above actions so think carefully before you do it. </span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Settings</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reset and clean up</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restore settings to their original default</span></li></ul><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ggctaoau2ij"><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Keep Chrome Updated</strong></span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best ways to avoid problems is to keep Chrome updated.
