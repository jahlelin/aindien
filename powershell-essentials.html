Beginners</strong></h2><p> </p><p>It has been around a long time and has been through several versions already. Many information technology people have waited to become familiar with this tool. They did so because many were not sure it would continue to be supported in the future.</p><p>Well we now know that not only has it continued to be supported but it is the preferred way by many to administer a Windows environment. So continue with me and we will discuss the basics so that you can go on and make this a long learning endeavor.</p><p>Powershell is a command oriented scripting environment. This means that you can open up a console and run a series of commands to accomplish various tasks. It also means that you can run a series of commands as a script over and over.</p><p>Scripting is very important for your environment as it lets you automate certain tasks over and over.</p><p>If you work in <a href="http://aindien.com/how-to-make-the-jump-to-system-administrator.html">information technology</a> then you need to start learning this as soon as possible. There is much you can do with it and there will be even more you can do with it in the future. It will help you earn more money in your career too. Who can really argue with that?</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt8pu761" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Using The Help System</strong></h3><p> </p><p>So you have convinced yourself to start learning Powershell for beginners. Now what? The single best piece piece of advice I can give is to learn the help system. Let me give you a short example. I was asked the other day to do something.</p><p>I had no idea at the time how to do it. So I went to my desk and opened up the console and started the help system. From a console it is [get-help] and looks like this.</p><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-833 size-full"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/powershell-for-beginners-1.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/powershell-for-beginners-1-xs.png 300w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/powershell-for-beginners-1-sm.png 480w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/powershell-for-beginners-1-md.png 768w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/powershell-for-beginners-1-lg.png 1024w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/powershell-for-beginners-1-xl.png 1360w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/powershell-for-beginners-1-2xl.png 1600w" alt="powershell for beginners 1" width="1090" height="182"></figure><p>I had a slight idea of what command I would need and looked at the help options for it. I was actually wrong the first time so then tried another option which would work eventually.</p><p>The important thing to learn here is that using the help system allows you to see the options and arguments with helpful descriptions to see if a command might work for you.</p><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-834 size-full"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/Powershell-for-Beginners-2.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-for-Beginners-2-xs.png 300w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-for-Beginners-2-sm.png 480w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-for-Beginners-2-md.png 768w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-for-Beginners-2-lg.png 1024w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-for-Beginners-2-xl.png 1360w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-for-Beginners-2-2xl.png 1600w" alt="Powershell for Beginners 2" width="1086" height="255"></figure><p>I wanted to import a third party module and the help showed me how to do it.</p><p>To start lets make sure you have the current version of help so you have all of its benefits. Type the command in yellow at your prompt.</p><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-835 size-full"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/Powershell-For-Beginners-3.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-3-xs.png 300w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-3-sm.png 480w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-3-md.png 768w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-3-lg.png 1024w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-3-xl.png 1360w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-3-2xl.png 1600w" alt="Powershell For Beginners 3" width="1087" height="179"></figure><p>The help system will even give examples. This is especially handy like when your totally unfamiliar with a command. Below is an example.</p><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-836 size-full"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/Powershell-For-Beginners-4.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-4-xs.png 300w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-4-sm.png 480w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-4-md.png 768w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-4-lg.png 1024w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-4-xl.png 1360w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-4-2xl.png 1600w" alt="Powershell For Beginners 4" width="1077" height="357"></figure><p>As you can see it shows two different examples of how to use this command. There were actually lots of examples but the following ones get more and more niche.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt8pu762" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Powershell Terminology</strong></h3><p> </p><p>There are several terms you should know in this Powershell for beginners guide. They are not difficult at all but will help so you know what the help system is trying to tell you.</p><ul><li>Cmdlet</li><li>Parameter</li><li>Alias</li><li>Function</li><li>Variable</li><li>Module</li></ul><p>A Cmdlet is the command you will be typing. It has a nice naming convention that will be of the verb-noun format. The verb parts are actions that do something. Example of verbs are import, set, get, and stop.</p><p>The noun parts are what the verbs act upon. This could be module, process, help, or service.</p><p>Parameters customize what a Cmdlet will do. You will see the parameters of a Cmdlet when using the help for it. To use a parameter you will use a dash, a space, the parameter name, another space, and a value.</p><p>An Alias is another form of a Cmdlet that you use a lot. It is a shortcut basically. You can make an Alias by the below syntax.</p><figure class="wp-image-837 size-large"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/Powershell-For-Beginners-5-1024x527.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-5-1024x527-xs.png 300w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-5-1024x527-sm.png 480w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-5-1024x527-md.png 768w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-5-1024x527-lg.png 1024w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-5-1024x527-xl.png 1360w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-5-1024x527-2xl.png 1600w" alt="Powershell For Beginners 5" width="1024" height="527"></figure>Powershell For Beginners<p></p><p>You can see from the above command that I made a shortcut to calc.exe and named it just c. So then when I typed c at the prompt my calculator opened. You can do this for any Cmdlet to save you time so make use of it when the need arises.</p><p>A Function is a piece of code that is re-usable. If you have any programming experience at all then you are already familiar with this terminology.</p><p>Variables are just the same as they are in <a href="http://aindien.com/how-to-read-data-from-a-file-with-c.html">programming languages</a>. They hold values. It is like an empty box until it has a value.</p><p>Modules are a series of commands that are related to other products usually.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt8pu763" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Piping Commands</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Powershell, just like other tools, can send the output of one command into another command. This is called piping. In the syntax you do it with a vertical bar just like with Unix. Look at the following example.</p><p>I have a simple text file on my desktop with some content inside. I am going to run two different commands which are [Get-Content] and [Measure-Object].</p><p>However, I am going to do it in one line and pipe the output of [Get-Content] into the [Measure-Object] command so that it can do its magic.</p><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-838 size-full"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/Powershell-For-Beginners-6.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-6-xs.png 300w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-6-sm.png 480w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-6-md.png 768w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-6-lg.png 1024w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-6-xl.png 1360w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-6-2xl.png 1600w" alt="Powershell For Beginners 6" width="1093" height="125"></figure><p>I used the [Get-Content] Cmdlet or command followed by the path to my text file that I wanted to analyze with [Measure-Object]. I then used a vertical bar to pipe its output into [Measure-Object].</p><p>You should also notice that I used the parameters character, line, and word for [Measure-Object]. So pretty interesting for sure. This is just one example of piping Powershell for beginners.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt8pu764" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Running Scripts</strong></h3><p> </p><p>What is scripting? Scripting is the automation of tasks. You usually perform a task every time you type out a full working command in Powershell. To get scripting working you will need to set things up first.</p><p>By default Powershell is set to only run signed scripts. So to run your own scripts you will need to change this behavior. Run the following command below.</p><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-840 size-full"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/Powershell-For-Beginners-7.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-7-xs.png 300w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-7-sm.png 480w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-7-md.png 768w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-7-lg.png 1024w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-7-xl.png 1360w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-7-2xl.png 1600w" alt="Powershell For Beginners 7" width="1083" height="129"></figure><p>You will need to run this as an administrator. There are several other execution policies available but this is the one I recommend. You should not use the -unrestricted policy. It is too insecure.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt8pu765" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Commenting Code</strong></h3><p> </p><p>You should always comment whatever code or commands you type so that you or others will know exactly what is meant. Systems can break with the wrong commands so comment so that everyone knows exactly what is happening or will happen.</p><p>To comment you add a # on the line of code that you do not want to execute.</p><figure class="aligncenter wp-image-841 size-full"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/Powershell-For-Beginners-8.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-8-xs.png 300w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-8-sm.png 480w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-8-md.png 768w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-8-lg.png 1024w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-8-xl.png 1360w, file:///C:/Users/Owner/Dropbox/Websites/aindiens-computer-guides/input/media/posts/27/responsive/Powershell-For-Beginners-8-2xl.png 1600w" alt="Powershell For Beginners 8" width="1068" height="101"></figure><p>That's easy enough. Lets move on then.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1dqt8pu766" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Variables</strong></h3><p> </p><p>As mentioned above somewhere, a variable is an empty container.

It is how most people get started. We often have a quick task or need some information quickly on a remote machine.<br><br><br>These kind of uses are ideal for shells. They are ideal because they are quick and reliable. I was a Linux user long before Powershell existed. So when I needed to work on a Windows machine, the first thing I did was learn its shell environment.<br><br><br>Others may look for a tool with a gui and that is perfectly acceptable if that is what you want. However, when you get used to working with shells and their advantages, you never want to use anything else.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1g8ua4s45o" class="align-center"><br><br><strong>Running A Command</strong></h3><p><br><br>A Powershell command always has a verb-noun structure. Something like:<br><br><br><code>get-content</code><br><br>It is done like this so it is relatively easy to know what the command does. </p><p>You can use the help system to learn how to use a particular command. This will probably be a very often used technique. There have been many times when I have forgot a command and just had to search for it.</p><p>So I do appreciate having this ability built in to the system. It has helped me greatly, as I am fairly forgetful at times.<br><br><br><code>get-help get-content -examples</code><br><br><br>This will give you several details and a few good examples of the command. It does not go into the full depth of the command. That is an option though. The help system will also tell you of any required parameters.<br><br><br>If it is required, then you must supply that information in order for the command to run. If any parameter includes spaces then you will need to enclose it in quotation marks. Commands are also not case sensitive.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1g8ua4s45p" class="align-center"><br><br><strong>Using Aliases</strong></h3><p><br>Aliases can be a convenient way to remember long commands. It is one of the powershell essentials that will always be useful. Some of these long commands are just a pain. In these instances, using an alias makes a lot of sense. It is what they are for.<br><br><br>There is a nice way to find out if a command has an alias. So, if it is a pain to type or you type it a lot, then try this.<br><br><br><code>get-alias -definition get-content</code><br><br><br>This does indeed tell us there is an alias for the "get-content" command.<br>It is "gc".<br><br><br>If you need to know what an alias is, then there is a way for that also. I know I can never remember anything but the most basic ones. I end up having to use this a lot. People like to use aliases when they write code.<br><br><br><code>help gc</code><br><br><br>This will give you the full command and all of its details.</p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1g8ua4s45q" class="align-center"><strong>Useful Commands</strong></h3><p><br><br>For the rest of this chapter I want to go over some of the more useful commands. I want to do this so you will start to become familiar as soon as possible with them.<br><br><br><em><strong><code>get-childitem</code></strong></em><br><br><br>This command will list files in a certain location. Use it like this.<br><br><br><code>get-childitem c:/Documents</code><br><br><br>This is useful when you want to check if there is anything in a directory. You can use the "-recurse" option to list subfolders and files.<br><br><br><em><strong><code>copy-item</code></strong></em><br><br><br>Thanks to Powershell's naming scheme, it is pretty easy to figure out what most commands do. This is a good example. Copying an item to another location is easy with this command.<br><br><br><code>get-childitem c:\users\username -recurse | copy-item -destination c:\folder</code><br><br><br>This reads the information in with the previous command and copies those items to another folder. That's pretty useful!<br><br><br><em><strong><code>export-csv</code></strong></em><br><br><br>When you need reports of things, this is the command to use. It will take the output of another command and make a "csv" file of it. Let's try a few.<br><br><br><code>get-process | export-csv -path c:\export\process_report.csv</code><br><br><br>Put that in your shell and you will get a lot of information about the processes running on your system right now. It will be a file in the folder you just specified. We can make it look a little nicer so lets do that.<br><br><br><code>get-process | export-csv -notypeinformation -path c:\export\process_report.csv</code><br><br><br>That extra flag will hide some of the useless stuff that comes with the file. Now let's customize the information. We can use the "select-object" command to select the columns we want. Let's just see the handles processname.<br><br><br><code>get-process | select-object handles, processname |export-csv -path c:\export\process_report.csv</code><br><br><br>If we needed just those two columns for some reason, then we would have them. This is a useful command and I have also shown how to link different commands together.</p><h3 id="mcetoc_1g8ua4s45r" class="align-center"><br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p><br><br>In this chapter we started with how to run a basic command. These commands were basic forms with no parameters added. We then took a look at aliases and how they can be useful. Afterwards, we even went over how to create your own alias.<br><br><br>Then I showed some of these basic commands in action. They are all nice to know and can be very helpful in the right situations. I gave examples and even showed how to create some files with your reporting.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 26, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://aindien.com/powershell/">Powershell</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fpowershell-essentials.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Faindien.com%2Fpowershell-essentials.html&amp;via=_Aindien&amp;text=Powershell%20Essentials%20For%20The%20New%20Admin" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://aindien.com/authors/jason-moore/" class="invert" rel="author">Jason Moore</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://aindien.com/how-to-run-powershell-commands.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> How To Run Powershell Commands</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://aindien.com/how-to-use-strings-in-c.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> How To Use Strings In C++ </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://aindien.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-05-13T22:31" class="feed__date">May 13, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/how-to-run-powershell-commands.html" class="invert">How To Run Powershell Commands</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-09-19T13:44" class="feed__date">September 19, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/linux-essentials.html" class="invert">Linux Essentials</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-08-04T22:58" class="feed__date">August 4, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://aindien.com/networking-essentials.html" class="invert">Networking Essentials For The PC Technician</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="banner banner--after-post"><div class="wrapper"><link href="//cdn-images.mailchimp.com/embedcode/classic-10_7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"><style type="text/css">#mc_embed_signup{background:#fff; clear:left; font:14px Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; }
