These situations include, among others, how to allocate scarce resources in partnerships, firms, friendships, and families. You may wonder what economics has to do with friendships and families. It has a lot to do with them.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are important situations when the behavior of others affects your payoffs. Game theory is the economic framework that describes our optimal actions in such settings. A Nash equilibrium is a situation where none of the players can do better by choosing a different action or strategy for themselves. Nash equilibria are applicable to a wide variety of problems, including zero-sum games, the tragedy of the commons, and the prisoner’s dilemma.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game theory is the study of situations in which the payoff of one agent depends not only on his or her actions, but also on the actions of others. It emerged as a branch of mathematics that first focused on the analysis of parlor games. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A payoff matrix represents the payoffs for each action players can take in a game. A best response is simply one player’s optimal strategy, taking the other player’s strategy as given. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a player has the same best response to every possible strategy of the other player, then we say that the player has a dominant strategy. In the prisoner’s dilemma, confessing is a dominant strategy, because it is your best response to any strategy choice of your partner. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, this equilibrium leads to an outcome that is not best for both players. Life doesn’t always present a game that has a dominant strategy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the essence of the equilibrium concept proposed by John Nash, in equilibrium, no player in a game can change strategy and improve his or her payoff. Therefore, a combination of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if each player chooses a strategy that is a best response to the strategies of others, that is, players are choosing strategies that are mutual best responses. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This notion of equilibrium depends on two critical factors: that all players understand the game and the payoffs associated with each strategy and that all players understand that other players understand the game.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to finding Nash equilibria is to determine whether either player has an incentive to change his strategy. It is also a common occurrence in game theory to have more than one Nash equilibrium. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game theory is most often used when a few players make choices that affect each other’s payoffs. The same type of reasoning applies even when the number of players is large. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A zero-sum game means that because one player’s loss is another’s gain, the sum of the payoffs is zero. Applying our method of finding Nash equilibria, we draw the arrows. They show that no Nash equilibrium exists, because no cell in the matrix has two arrows pointing in. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We say that a strategy is dominated if it yields lower payoffs than some other available strategy. It is a basic tenet of game theory that no player should pick a dominated strategy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The games that we have discussed so far all revolve around two players choosing an action simultaneously. Suppose that, instead, one player goes first and the other chooses an action only after seeing how the first player chose. This type of situation, which specifies the order of play, is represented by an extensive-form game.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we can say that an extensive-form game specifies the order of play and payoffs that will result from different strategies and uses a game tree to represent them.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The easiest way of approaching any extensive-form game is to use backward induction. Backward induction is the procedure of solving an extensive-form game by first considering the last mover’s decision. So, backward induction involves starting at the end of a game and solving it backwards. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A commitment is an action that one cannot take back. Commitments, which come before other actions, can change who has the advantage.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Game theory provides us with the tools to examine situations when players’ payoffs are intertwined. Whether decisions are made simultaneously or sequentially, game theory is about being able to see the world through the eyes of your opponent and understand the opponents incentives.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key concepts of game theory are best responses and Nash equilibria. A best response is one agent’s optimal strategy taking the other player’s strategy as given. When the same strategy is the best response against any possible strategies of the other players, then it is a dominant strategy. In most games, players do not possess such a dominant strategy, making their best responses depend on the strategy choices of other players.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Nash equilibrium arises if each player chooses a strategy that is a best response to the strategies of other players. Put differently, a Nash equilibrium is a combination of strategies that are mutual best responses.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of Nash equilibrium enables us to make predictions about behavior in a range of situations, including those that can be modeled as the prisoner’s dilemma, the tragedy of the commons, and zero-sum games. It also helps us understand why trustworthy behavior is more likely to emerge when players have reputational concerns. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose there are cable tv companies in your city, Astounding cable and Broadcast cable.

Since his monopoly is now insecure, Bill has two options; he can continue to act as a monopolist and allow the second software firm to enter the market, or he can try to prevent the other firm from entering the market by producing a greater quantity at a lower cost.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Bill acts as a secure monopoly and produces a low quantity at a high price, then Larry:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will enter</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Bill acts as an insecure monopoly and produces a greater quantity at a lower price, then Larry:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay out</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The logical move for Bill is to produce:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High quantity</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming Bill acts logically, then the logical move for Larry is to:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay out</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming Bill and Larry act logically, then Bill’s profit will be:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1000 and Larry’s profit will be 0</span></li></ol><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an example of:</span></p><ol><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extensive game</span></li></ol><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of your coworkers, Freddie, really gets on your nerves and it would dramatically increase your happiness if he was fired. Freddie also dislikes you and wishes you would be fired. You have the option of going to your boss and lying about Freddie harassing you, which you are sure will get him fired.
